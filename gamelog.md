# Game Log

## 2020-05-16-S -- Session 001 #S001

Our story begins with us unable to move and panicked. Stark chemical smell in the air. Crash couch enveloping our bodies. Klaxons screaming bleeding through the claustrophobic grip of the crash couch, and the ship shudders violently towards the surface of the planet we've never been to before. But it didn't start out like this...

We were individually approached by a Derendali merchant - **Herandor Vonketosen**. Made contact in his private quarters. We eyeball each other over a low table. Each of us had responded to a subtle advertisement for work befitting our talents. Table is laid out with small dishes and drinks. We've been waiting for 45 minutes or so for him to come out of his private quarters and meet us.

**Emrite** - all black jumpsuit. Hair braided and back. Ambiguous and forgettable. Laser pistol at her side.

\*\*Weird not to be carrying some form of personal protection. Need to be able to defend yourself until security forces show. Standard issue rifle is normal, larger weapons are conspicuous. If you're in armor, you're expecting that's necessary.

**Rahim** - Palestinian Han Solo

**Kruti** - Ellaria Sand. Loose-fitting britches, knee-high boots over flowing top. Pistol at side. Backpack.

Harandor hasn't been in the shipping industry for very long - Vanketosen shipping is about 8 weeks old. In good standing with authorities. Caste system is strictly divided - Military/Psychic, Compulsory service (most people remain here), Discharged/Unable To Serve (Merchants), and Vonketosen is definitely in the merchant class. Makes sense for him to be reaching out to us outside the law, since this is his best opportunity.

Framed Derendali flight suit of significant rank with his name embroidered on the side ofit on the wall, in a place of honor & highlighted, when we came in. Framed case next to it of Derendali medals of service. He's a decorated captain. Weird that it didn't show up when we looked him up.

Food is running low, have cooled, and drinks are nearly gone. He still hasn't come out.

When we showed up, an electronic call & response let us in. Unintelligent service drone served us food & drink. It's an expensive residential area. It's a receiving area with incense burning. Incense is like art hanging on the wall, and this incense is good and expensive - lit fresh when we showed up.

We're looking through a well-stocked kitchen, when we hear a thump come from upstairs - a single heavy object being dropped on carpet. Emrite suggests checking it out, and we head upstairs. We smell the strong scent of alcohol. We find a figure hanging torso off the bed with a mostly-empty bottle of liquor on the ground. He is wearing a silk robe and silk pants underneath and seems to be dead/passed out/unclear?

Emrite checks for a pulse. He is surrounded in a cloud of alcoholic haze. The bottle is 90% empty, and she thinks she knows where that 90% is... He's breathing, but shallowly. This is definitly Vonketosen. As Emrite and Kruti move him onto the bed, he makes mewling noises and attempts speech, but is massively inebriated.

We see a small bottle of fruit nectar that might've made a good mixer, but not for all of the alcohol that he's consumed. On the other side of the bed, scattered around the floor are bank statement printouts - with considerable red ink. Near the statements is a military officer's sidearm - a charged laser pistol, safety on.

There's lots scattered around. It's densely packed with things accumulated over life. It becomes obvious that he was a pilot. Images displayed in frames, art on the wall, photos of others in flight gear, etc. It will probably take a few hours for him to come out of this, unless we do something else to speed it up. Emrite and Rahim begin to look around the estate for a medkit.

Kruti checks his pockets and finds his compad, which he's left unlocked. There is a half-composed email/letter. It starts out incoherent _and gets worse_.

`youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuudddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd ............. ;a`

The recipient is already keyed in: **Shenkor Mohejen**. Kruti has never heard this name before. She pokes into the rest of the emails. There are so many past due notices in his inbox that it looks like a spam folder. It appears that he's a broke person attempting to stay in high society. Limo services, air taxes, expensive food delivery, etc.

Kruti looks at the financial documents and figures out that most of his wealth was in investments - hugely diversified - but within the same week, his banks told him that "Due to a discrepency in your accounts and issues with the origins of your investments, we have zeroed out your accounts."

Rahim and Emrite find a medkit, but almost all the drugs have already been taken. There is one dose remaining of a mild stimulant in a single-use spray - like two more pills at the bottom of a container of caffeine pills. In looking in his wardrobe, we find a military full dress uniform.

Rahim stims Vonketosen, who promptly vomits all over him, begins to try to throttle him, and curses Shenkor. Rahim manages to push him back onto the bed, where is sobbing like a child. Emrite asks him if he's ok, and if he would like a shower. His service drone offers laundry service, which Rahim takes adavantage of. We hear crying from the shower, and shortly thereafer, Vonketosen emerges dressed and cleaned. Rahim gets a suit.

He's destitute. He can't afford the house, his cars have been repossessed, and he expects to be evicted. We are his literal last hope. He'll be on the street shortly. He's a desparate man. Emrite asks what he needs. Crudely put, he needs more money than God. He believes that he knows where to find it, in return for a slice of it.

He asked if we have heard of Shenkor, a Coven Intelligence Agent, and his rival for a promotion in the agency. He learned of his situation before Vonketosen did - a fortune built on lies. Thought to be shipping magnates, built upon a ponzi scheme. He inherited his wealth. Was "a motherfucker of a pilot," but inherited his money.

He was up for a position training pilots for intel/observation craft. Mohejen figured out the false fortune, and saw fit to alert all institutions simultaneously. We are to be the instruments on his revenge. In exchange for being the viscious hand of retribution against this cumstain of a man, we will be made rich beyond our wildest dreams. He's landlocked - but we are not. He knows about several opportunities he meant to pursue after his service to the coven.

He knows of a cache of pre-tech on Hartoum, one jump away. The locals are... questionably aware of it. He believes that we can get there, recover it, and bring it back to him. Or, at least, firm evidence of its existence. He can leverage his reputation to retreive the rest and make us fabulously wealthy. Why not take it for ourselves? Vonketosen believes that when he bonded with his familiar, more of the animal made it into him. He's an accomplished telepath, and suggests that we not end up in the same room.

When we leave, he will be consuming the remainder of his alcohol and getting so drunk that he will forget the majority of the conversation. When we accomplish what he's sent us to do, we will give him a passphrase, and give him a treasure to double his initial fortunes. We cannot bring it off Hartoum, but he could make that happen.

The pre-tech can see things that travel over the speed of light. If we can locate and secure the observatory, he should be able to outmaneuver Shenkor and make us rich. The best he can tell us is that it's somewhere near Carromir, a simple village. Stories of the observatory are traced back to this village. We're probably not the only ones looking. He has some hard currency remaining to get us transport. We can't get our own ship, but should be able to get passage on a trading ship. We would have standard passenger fare.

He believes he would be able to offer us 1MM credits of astronautical work at the shipyards - enough for a reasonably valuable ship. We agree, and he heads out to his kitchen. We put together an order for some extra stuff, and it should be delivered to the **Benorgu Beauty** - a medkit, a Hartoum survival kit, a shear rifle, 5 line shunts, trade metals, and a bioscanner.

We get pings about 10m after we step outside with flight itineraries to board the ship in 16 hours. It's a trading ship with passenger service, and is bound for Hartoum and Points Further. It drills into the system, ferries people with the shipboard shuttle, and drills out.

We leave, and go to a bar to get to know each other a little better.

## -- RESEARCH --

Emrite pulls out her dataslab and looks for information on Shenkor Mohejen. She finds a reference to an awards ceremony when he entered the intelligence service and earned a high medal for achievement. In the photo, he looks extraordinarily nondescript. Military haircut, no tattoos or scars. He's a man of slight build.

Herendor isn't mentioned much. His entry to pilot candidacy school, but they don't publish much regarding their military exploits. His most recent hit is a public news article of how he was dismissed from military service dishonorably two months ago. Within two weeks, he was dishonorably discharged and all of his investments vanished. His parents died about a year ago. His father was a business magnate, and his death was notable.

We learn a few things about one another:

```
Emrite spent 15 years of her life traveling with her bounty hunter godmother, a talented psychic who taught her what she could.

While employed with the Merchant Marines, Rahim mapped a faster route between Jerash and Vindelicorum.

Kruti is a procurer and augmentor of goods. She's not a drug dealer, but she can get you what you want.
```

We decide not to dig further into Shenkor, and head for the Beauty.

## -- The Beauty --

The Beauty is a sizable frigate with a considerable weapon mounted. We head through the crowds to the ship. We board, find our seats (in a block next to each other). The docking clamps release, and we take off. We head towards the edge of the system and begin the spike drill to Hartoum.

Our ticket includes a coffin-hotel sleeping space and meager food. There's a common eating space that we eat at in shifts. Common knowledge is that people are going to Hartoum for a pilgrimage. People spend some time on Hartoum, which is deliberately very simple - TL 2, Industrial Revolution - so that they can live a simple life for religious contemplation.

There was never a jump gate here. The colony ship in orbit was a small, floating city. Portions of it are still powered, and people live on it. Some of it functions as an abbey or monestary, serving a religion that sprang up around the settling of this sector. Chunks of the ship have fallen from orbit and survived.

A ship with standard scanning ablities and a telemetry will be able to look at a planet and get relatively simple data back - atmosphere, geology, advanced energy-using surface communities, ships in orbit, and features designed to attract orbital interest. We'd need dedicated scanning tech to find things from orbit.

We come to and are able to emerge from the crash couch into the blinding light on the surface of Hartoum. Something broke - a tremendous bang - on the shuttle, and we spiraled down fast enough to pin us to the floor. At the last moment, emergency safety protocols engaged, and the cabin filled with impact-absorbing foam. Also contains a potent sedative.

We're standing in a large crater. The shuttle, that held 50 people, and is scattered around the crater. The largest chunk at the bottom is burning heavily. The cargo portion cracked, and there is a line of baggage around 800 ft long. The sun is overhead and beautiful, the air is fresh and breathable, and a deer looks down on us from the top of the crater. We realize that we're ravenous - like we haven't eaten in days - maybe haven't drank in that long, either.

It looks like there's considerable blood along the other crash couches. Crash foam is meant to be tenuous life support system, but also built to decay before they run out of oxygen. It takes 4 days to degrade to the point where the foam will break and we can move naturally.

There's a lot of cratered, shattered foam around with blood on the outside. It went into several big portions and other tiny portions. 3 main chunks fragmented the way it was supposed to. It looks like someone went through the baloons of safety foam, cut or burned them open, and executed the people inside the pods. There are clear marks of laser fire on the bodies inside.

The other poeple in our bloom of foam were killed. A chunk of the shuttle fell on our forner of the pod, and we just happened to be under a chunk of ship. It seems as though we were assumed dead or crushed, and we escaped whatever befell those who traveled with us.

We're in an environment like the scottish highlands. We're all but certain that we're the only survivors. 75 helpless people were killed by whoever raided this crash site. We head towards the cargo field.

A lot survived. The full furrow of the ship is 2,000 ft long or so. Most of the cargo is clothes, effects, etc. Some hard case cargo containers have survived.

Over an hour and a half, we're able to put together a pile of things that weren't shredded by the crash, including our cargo container. Emrite opens up the crate. The internal framing is destroyed.

The medkit, shear rifle, and trade metals survived.

The survival kit, line shunts, and bioscanner were destroyed.

We're able to crack into the first class portions of food on the shuttle. We have 10 person/days of food and water.

As we check out the shattered remnatns of the shuttle, we come across the portion of the shuttle that contained the escape pods. There are 6 pods. 5 are still attached and crushed beyond repair - 1 is missing.

## 2020-05-23-S -- Session 002 #S002

We are in the smoking crater of the ship's boat. Something terrible happened on our way down, and so we have awakened several days after the crash. It's roughly 4AM.

"The crash has really thrown a wrench in your plans."

We stand on the lip of the crater. Emrite uses the light on her metatool to look at the area around us and notices that the ground around us is incredibly muddy. That's odd, since we're at the top of a hill... The trees around us look odd as well. Those near us have mud splashed on them up around mid-thigh height. There is something splashing in a nearby mud puddle.

Kruti takes out her light as well and we see a mostly-translucent speckled 6-tentacled cephalopod. Nearby, another also splashes in the puddle. It's a muggy bog. We're a good 75 ft above the plains below us.

We see lots of broken trees, but they aren't pointed towards the crater. Kruti attempts to fix the bioscanner and accomplishes her task in about an hour. Rahim figures out that the cockpit isn't disintegrated on impact, and landed belly-first. There may be salvagable data or systems in that cockpit. He also knows that he doesn't know much about the squids, but he's fairly certain they don't belong here.

Emrite searches the perimeter, armed with her shear rifle and laser pistol. She finds the burning trail of stuff behind the ship. She makes her way down the hill and gets the sense that there is considerable water here, flowing back to the NW - in the direction the shuttle crashed down from. She's about 3/4 of the way around when she finds the body of a sheep... in a large tree... 18ft off the ground...speared on a broken branch...

It's been dead for a while - smelt before seen, and the tree is spattered at least that far in black mud. The sheep is outside the splash range of the ship's crash, and has been dead for longer than 4 days.

Rahim makes his way to the cockpit. There's no body inside. Blood everywhere, but not bodies. There are holes in the flight console like someone shot it with a very powerful weapon. There is intact equipment, and Rahim is able to access the shuttle's computer.

- Last known location

  - Rahim assists via INT Pilot
  - Kruti figures out the ship went down just 26 km NW of the colony

- External force or mechanical failure

  - The shuttle had a series of catastrophic failures in sequence.
  - 10m before atmo, atmo sealant failure, atmo vented hard. To keep the cabin alive, the pilots executed a hard dive into atmo, which would shred the outside of the shuttle but keep passengers oxygenated. Shuttle hull badly damaged.
  - Just after atmo, pilot lifesigns flatlined. Severe damage to instrumentation.
  - After atmo was completed, 1 escape pod jettisoned (15 person capacity, 3 people inside). No other pods jettisoned before impact.

We realize that there have been no bodies left.

We expect full sunrise at 7am. We realize that the bog level is high, and that this isn't normal. Something has gone terribly wrong with this landscape. There are additional drowned sheep in the trees, and the trees are awash with black mud. Rivulets of water run everywhere. It's clear that there was a terrible flood here.

We decide to take some time and resources (spare parts, shuttle seats, escape pod engines, etc.) to create a crude hovercraft. We salvage enough energy in a B-cell to power the craft for 4 days. We board the Gender Neutral and Rahim takes the pilot's seat.

On our maiden voyage, the craft works! It stayes together, rattles a bunch, and is propelled by maneuvering pods from the escape pod. It makes a noise like a steam train in a tunnel, and rattles so hard it feels like one might chip a tooth. At some point, we hear a clang and a splash, and none of us can figure out what fell off...

The sun is high, we are all hot, and catching bugs in our teeth. Our passing is a vulgar affront to a fairly quiet scene as we realize that a recent flood has devestated the highlands. Whatever trees are still rooted are centers of debris islands - fallen trees, dead livestock, etc.

The craft works better on the water, but we begin to smell rot. We pass a pale, naked, human body - and then more. Scavenging birds circle overhead, scattered by the sound of our craft. Faces turn towards us as we approach where Carromir used to be. People are wading through the water up to their waists, chests. They're naked or half-naked, some in nightclothes... There's a river here that has broken its banks. Fish and strange squid everywhere. Birds love the squid, so they're not rotting in too many places.

We hear a bell ring out ahead of us and see houses piled together. We think we arrived at Carromir. As we're approaching, the water pushes us downstream atop a river heading through the middle of the settlement. A tree suddenly rises up like we had stepped on a rake. Rahim cranks the wheel. An engine bottle rockets away. We jerk away from the tree, clipping the ass of the craft, but avoid smashing full-on into the tree. We are intact, but rattled. We have arrived at what remains of Carromir.

Everything is stained with mold and lichen. People all over shout, wail, and haul makeshift skiffs of their things. People are barely getting their shit together from the catastrophic flood. Nearest us, an old man drags a drowned body onto makeshift docs cobbled together from broken beams. To our right, a priest from the pilgrimage site clings to a log, shrieking "Everything is ruined, oh god..." etc. etc. and seems to have run out of reasons to get out of the water. A woman rafting atop a large door is trying to keep several people atop her craft.

We're still far out from the buildings - 5-10 minutes - and haven't found dry land yet. Almost all water is knee-waist deep, and the center of the river is tree deep.

Life here is a complete mess.

Several miles NE of Carromir is a visible column of steam. The river continues on, but the people are devastated. There isn't much we can do for them, so we continue along.

Closer to the building are more people. Two women on a low hillock. One is screaming, audible over the roar of our apocalypse boat, often repeating "UNCLEAN MEAT". Next to her, paying apparently no attention, is an ancient crone of a woman with a corpse next to her, grabbing it by the head, and staring intently into its mouth. We pass them by as well. The screaming woman sees us, points at our craft, and continues to scream about "UNCLEAN MEAT".

We pass the remains of a building on a muddy hill, barely sticking out of the water. A man, almost as old as the crone, stands - dressed well, soaked to the bone. He is using his bare hands to scrape out shallow graves for bodies laid over the hill. Next to him, in a half-wrecked buidling, is a woman in her mid-20s, surrounded by a screaming group of 7-9yo children. They're all shouting at her, asking her where their parents are. She's frantically trying to calm them, and looks at our craft with an uninterpretable glance.

We decide to stop and have a chat with the schoolmarm. 2/4 walls were ripped away, and the building is half-collapsed. She wears a soaked dress, shivering. The children are also soaked, spattered in mud. Kruti bioscans the teacher and finds she's in relative good health - hungry, cold, but not poisoned or dying.

Emrite asks what happened, and the woman says there was a flood. The dam burst, the water came and washed away the town. She wants to know if we have any food, and that the children are starving. Kruti asks when this happened, and it has apparently been 6-7 days. Emrite asks about the dam. She points vaguely upriver, but doesn't know anything about the dam. She asks if we're there to help, and Emrite responds no. The woman looks crestfallen. She asks if we can take them to safety, but we can't.

She seems lost in her own thoughts, and the children begin screaming again. **Miss Trowen** begins sobbing as the children overwhelm her again. We push off and head upriver towards the dam.

Along the way, about halfway towards the cluster of buildings, a large mound of freshly turned soil with pale limbs sticking out of it, moves and twitches. Near the pile is a tall, thin man, down on one knee, with his arm around a small child, talking to him conspiratorily. On the other side is the biggest group of people we've seen so far, hauling on beams of wood out of a stack. We see one teetering towards the top, and attempt to warn them. When that doesn't work, Emrite tries to hit it with her shear rifle in burst mode. The shear rifle makes absolutely no noise except for an external mechanism marking off three rounds from the battery. The structural beam just... falls apart.

We begin to enter the cluster of buildings, a rural village center. Higher buildings have planks across rooves or floors for traversal. People are taking notice of our roaring devastation vessel. Buildings are wood, painted to look like stone.

We see a guy with a messenger bag with multiple compads and dataslabs on the roof of a building, looking out with binoculars at the column of steam. There is a virutally naked, raggedly thin child creeping up behind him, and he looks completely unsuspecting. Meanwhile, a large crowd is gathered between two connected buildings with a muddy courtyard between them. They're shouting in anger at one man wearing spacers' overalls, and they appear to be about to actually lynch him.

Rahim tries to warn the guy, but ends up accidentally distracting him. The kid takes advantage of the opening and takes a compad from his bag.

A moment of listening to the people are accusing the man of being a thief, that he stole bread, etc. We disembark and approach the crowd from the rear.

In the mud at their feet is a messenger bag spilling out the same kind of preserved meals we had from our ship. It's been stepped on several times, and has 60/man/days of high-density food. The stencil on them says "The Latipan". Kruti picks up the bag, takes 6 units out, and makes her way to the front of the crowd. Emrite uses her telekinetic abilities to mitigate the noose temporarily. Kruti begins passing out food and tries to disperse the crowd.

The crowd quickly dies down until the last ones remaining are the prime lynch executors. A shock of realization comes over them, and they release the man. They look at Kruti. One asks where the food came from, and she responds that they were in such a hurry to kill him they stepped over their own food.

The name on his coverall is Kashusko, Max. Tattoos crawl up out of his coverall from his neck to behind his ear. They are floral themed, and they cover most of his body. He shakily gets to his feet, thanks Kruti, and takes some time to catch his breath. She distributes the remaining food, and they disperse. Towards the end, the woman who had had the noose in her hand, takes her food and apologizes to Max, but seems to think he would get it. He smiles, and says he gets it, "but maybe not twice, alright?"

Kruti bioscans him, and he seems generally bruised and sore, but will be ok. He says the whole place went insane about a week ago. A wall of water swept through. They were doing a medical dropoff. Blast from upriver. He heard it go off. Nobody fights onworld normally. It's usually a safe run. They go to take cover, and he sees the wall of water. Slammed into the town like a fist. Their ship got tumbled, and they'll be here months. The food gets scarce and they're treating each other miserably. This bag of food was sold by one of the idiot deckhands. Captain sent him to recover it, and they flipped shit saying he stole it from them. He'll vouch for us to his captain.

He says the people who live her are weird - and he chooses to live in space. These people choose to live 2000 years in the past. Emrite tells him we crash landed and he seems astonished. Apparently, they saw us come down like a comet. He says Captain Zarathusa is a sharp man, fair, but be polite. He's at the end of his rope right now between the people and the deckhand, shit's nuts.

We take him on our hovercraft over to the ship that has rolled into the center of town on a 30deg cant and a 45deg angle, wedged between two buildings. Where the wings were torn, the space between has been crudely filled in with expanding foam. Ladders hang for access and tarps hang for sun shields. Workmen shout and locals mill about shouting at people in the ship.

## 2020-05-30-S -- Session 003 #S003

Max takes us through Carromir and we see the devastation and recovery. Off to the far NE, there is a plume of steam that has reached up so high it has hit an atmospheric ceiling and has umbrella'd out into a thunderhead.

He leads us through the town and takes us to The Latipan, where there is a heated debate going on between a crowd roughly 1/3 the size of the lynch mob and Captain Zarathusa. She is holding a thorougly modded automatic laser rifle in her hands and looking thoroughly unimpressed. She has the calm demeanor of someone who know's they're holding a lethal weapon.

She appreciates that they're short on supplies, but they're not food merchants and they don't have enough to survive, themselves. There will be consequences for those who sold. They weren't overcharged, it was a crime for them to be charged in the first place. There will be no further food sales. The Carromirans are unhappy, and she asserts that they _will_ disperse -- **now**. She flicks the safety off on her rifle. Lots of angry shouting, but they do disperse.

Max looks uncomfortable. He says it'll be best if we're nice. They have a short-range network for text comms. We opt to take some time to repair the hovercraft, make connections, and shore up the safety features on the Gender Neutral. He doesn't know what they're eating with their farmland underwater. He's seeing lots of meat in the stewpots and he doesn't know where it's coming from... T_T Max heads back to the hatch on that Latipan, shouts up, and they crew lowers a rope ladder of extension cords to bring him up.

### Slang Highlight: Iron === Firearms, Hardware

We look to start scavenging materials from around town to repair and advance the Gender Neutral. In almost an hour, we're able to repair the craft. As we're finishing up, Kashusko pings us to let us know that the captain has calmed down and wants to see us aboard the Latipan.

We are able to dock the Gender Neutral close to the Latipan. The captain is waiting for us in Secure Tech clothing under coveralls with a sidearm. She has a hairpiece or headdress on her brow. Max emerges, talks to the crewmen, and they roll down the rope ladder. As we come aboard, it's pretty packed. We're in an upside-down ship. Three crew members (MMF) ask us to divest ourselves of any weapons. We agree, and our weapons go into a storage locker.

The ship is funhouse of upside-down doors and bulkheads and such. We enter a room with Captain Zarathusa and Max. We introduce ourselves, and she asks if they're sworn in or lapsed - active members of the military or not. They answer that they're lapsed (Emrite) and merchant (Kruti). She asks why we're here, and Rahim tells her we're on a retrieval mission for a few small items for a Derendali noble. She realizes we're freelancers, and says she may have use of us.

She wants The Latipan running again. She knows we were out cold when the dam blew, and believes military-grade explosives (phased plasma charge, gravitic force, gravtank) would be required to take out a Terran Mandate dam over 600 years old. She wants to know what happened. They have food on The Latipan for a while, and the people aren't starving but are afraid. She gives us a charged B cell in exchange for us investigating the dam and giving her scrapings of the char and a full report. She needs money getting the ship running again, and it doesn't pay for itself. In exchange, we'll get 500c a head with the data dump. Emrite asks for some spare pieces and safety gear for the Gender Neutral.

Kruti asks about their next stop, and she responds that they were coming through Derendal through Hartoum to Lians Trimph to Euripides through other planets to batamia(???). If they get off-planet, they'll take us with them. They can probably afford to make another Derendal stop.

We are not the only freelancers seen around Carromir. Many people don't look like pilgrims these days. If we leave for the dam, we'll be noticed, and should be careful. If we have anything we can sell, she can move it for us if she can get The Latipan off-planet. The remnants of the dam may have usable materials for repairs on The Latipan. We don't need to bring it back with us, but can toss a beacon on it.

It should at least be something to get the ship upright - most likely a controlled demo of the building it's resting on. She can feed us, but there are Terms and Conditions: We can't keep it in the ship-marked packaging, so it'll go bad more quickly. Max will set us up with basic needs.

They're persona non grata, but are willing to offer expertise and engineering in recovery efforts.

Comms are fragged except for short-range network.

Hull is battered, but not a complete lost cause. It's too awkward to launch, but could be repaired and righted and be spaceworthy.

Kruti also secures us a pressure tent.

She gives us a link to the ship's transponder, so we can ping the ship if we find working radio equipment. The only reason they have a LAN at all is that they repurposed someone's PS9-equivalent to rig it up.

We get a brief tour through the ship before Max hooks us up. We get a full B cell - enough to power the Gender Neutral for 2 weeks. We're given a canvas bag without the ship's mark with unwrapped rations rewrapped in extruded plastic bags. There are 5 days of food for all 3 of us (15 total units) in the bag. We also get an expandable pressure tent - this **is** marked with the Latipan's ship mark, which Max promptly covers in duct tape. He escorts us to the air lock where we receive our weapons and we are free to depart the ship.

We decide to leave for the dam. The column of steam is actually rising from further north from the dam. The water heads vaguely northeast towards the dam, but the steam is NNW from there.

The valley floor winds up towards the dam, and the land has become a flood plain. There are chunks of houses floating down - wreckage of other villages and towns. We follow the path of the river to avoid the trees coming up from the water. We're passing other spacers, mostly. Predators and scavengers are out eating dead fish and such. More squids and pike in the water, squids camoflauging as we pass.

We're heading upriver, fighting a strong current. We come upon 2 men facing each other, standing on the surface of the water with no apparent support. Each has a strange device in their hands - like their hand was fitted inside a basketball with a grip on the inside. They are furious with each other - pointing, shouting, and spitting in rage.

We pull closer. Nearby, we can see a small boat fitted with an outboard motor hidden in the reeds. The one closer to the W bank is... plump. He speaks Mandate Common with an unplacable accent with this device with shaking antennae on the end of it. "Pompous shitbag, overfunded fuckbutt" is said. Every violent gesture moves the water. The other looks anemic, like he's barely standing - but that's his default. He's flushed, and wearing a hat like a collapsed flan. "You took my funding, both stuck here with one boat and two devices and not enough to get the job done..." Rem Koolhaüs? His handwaves also create frothing water.

As we approach, they say they want us to observe their duel. We want to know more... They say we're clearly from offworld from our outfits - which are blasphemous - but are educated? They're anthropologists, studying the precursor race that lived on this planet before the Terran Mandate, with low opinions of the colonists. He found that his cohort farts too much eating the local food and takes up too much space in the canoe. Emrite asks how they're standing on the water. They look down and realize the bridge they're standing on is sinking. The fat one wishes the thin one is eaten by squid, and we realize they're on a bridge.

It's not his work that's impeded by the dam, it's the other one's work who thinks that they arrival of the Terran mandate turned them into a decent civilization. They're really fighting because they've been in a canoe for 5 days, spent all their money on the devices, and have decided that they can only solve their differences by dueling to the death. They each offer us money to kill the other and say the other won the duel. He says Rem Koolhaüs is a serial pedophile, but there is no proof, he's just trying to besmirch him. The balls they're using are psi-tech, harnessing an ability to manipulate water.

They were approaching the dam when it was suddenly deleted. He gestures towards a 4-ft fin rising out of the water, saying that it will probably tear his colleague apart. Emrite offers to take one of them aboard our craft and leave the other the canoe, and they seem pretty set on killing one another.

The floor of the canoe is carpeted in wrappers. There's no mechanical damage to the canoe, it's just out of gas. The creature is coming closer and closer. Emrite realizes it must be 20' long and is charging at the anthropologists. The creature hurls itself out of the water at one of the academics and appears to be an enormous Hartoumian River Pike. It looms with open jaws towards Rem Koolhaüs - the fat one.

Rahim fires at the pike, hitting it for minor damage through a fin. Emrite misses. Remtries to hit it with a water construct, but doesn't seem to affect it much. Kruti ties the canoe to the Gender Neutral.

Rahim misses the fish. Emrite manages to hit the fish in the eye, prompting it to toss Remback to the bridge. Remtakes an item that looks like two pencils end to end, activating it and throwing it towards the pike. It explodes! The fish is now scored with a gridded network of lines, chunks of it floating in the water. The fish soaks us with river water, Ruskin's hat further rekt. The pike flees. Kruti ignores the fish and asks Rem for his medkit, that he doesn't have. She uses his belt to tourniquet his leg.

We look for a place to lay low for the evening. Some land to the east might do,

Kruti stablizes Rem and dresses his wound. Emrite talks to Ruskin Behavior, asking what they were looking for. They didn't have enough fuel to get the whole way up the river, and his maps were outdated. They were trying to find remnants of glittering golden tombs. He thinks that the Terran Mandate civilized them, though they were able to keep some of their primitive practices. After many years of selective breeding, they were something that once was human. Koolhaüs says he thinks they were more advanced.

## 2020-06-13-S -- Session 004 #S004

We've found a place to camp and plan out our evening. The night passes coldly. The scholars demand a spot in the tent, but otherwise keep the peace for the evening. There's a low-lying fog as we wake to the river still overflowing its banks. We pack out, unhook the Gender Neutral, and continue on. Emrite spent the evening with one of the devices, but didn't uncover any additional functionality.

We continue on and see a church, rotated 90 degrees onto its side - the steeple is a broken crystal lense. The sides of the church seem whole, but the door is 10 ft up and closed. The bottom has enough stacked against it that we couldn't make our own entrance immediately.

It is surrounded by giant toads (roughly 20, about the size of obese men) that have obviously feasted on corpses, to the point where several have exploded and died from ridiculous overeating.

We then see two children huddled on a large metal casket coming down the river. Rahim pilots the Gender Neutral to move them over to the shore. As we lay them out and begin to tend to their health, Kruti and Emrite realize that they bear a major familial resemblence to the guy Emrite saved from the falling beam with the shear rifle.

We turn our attention to the box, which is caked with mud and detritis. We clear away the dirt and find ourselves looking at someone's face. We've exposed a porthole on the broad face of the box and are looking through the window at a very old face - hairless and wrinkled. He's not rotted or obviously dead, but isn't moving and seems sleeping or unresponsive. He's wearing a hospital gown or other simple garment. We find what look like elaborate, stenciled markings on the side. It's definitely metal, and has connections ports for some kinds of cables or gas nozzles or something. Between Rahim and Kruti, we figure out it's a long-term life support or stasis pod. Gas nozzles suggest gaseous medium. If he's dead, he's perfectly preserved. It's not breached or corroded. Emrite hooks up to it with her dataslab and figures out it's a suspension pod, and was last updated 550 years ago. This is Terran Mandate tech. The readout says:

### Sarcophagus-Class Argon Suspension Crypt

### Occupant: Client, "Haranana, Ambato"

The anthropologists are so engrossed in their current argument with each other that they haven't even noticed we stopped, let alone the children or the suspension pod. When asked, they won't admit that they don't know anything about this guy, but insist that the other doesn't know anything, either.

Emrite finds a file system in the sarcophagus containing a journal and last will and testament for the client - encrypted and password-proteceed. She takes some time to plan out a hack to access them - failing at first, but succeeding immediately after.

His will is written entirely conditionally ("If I were to die..."). The journal is more interesting. He was a maintainer on the dam, I think? It concerns funding and beaurocracy, overseen by admin AIs that tried to smooth funding over decades at a time. As funding for the project got more and more erratic, they had to go into suspended animation between supply drops - 4-5 times. By the 4th time it happens, they're no longer very concerned about sleeping away the next several decades. He's like 700 years old by a real-time calendar. The last time, they figured automation would maintain the dam via worker-robots cloned off their brain states such that they would continue to work while they were in animation and update them when they woke up to a new supply drop. The dam exploded, though, and is unlikely to have occured due to failure of the worker robots, etc.

Through context, she manages to get the names of the other overseers. The anthropologists have never heard of any of them, but the naming conventions match up with the Reed People - local historical people. A final piece of information - there is a power source embedded in the suspension crypt - a miniature fusion plant that could power the Latipan.

We decide to make a run back to the town, preferably after exploring the church past the toads. Kruti hucks a chunk of driftwood. The toad doesn't hop away, but doesn't seem inclined to move very much.

Kruti consults her precognitive abilities to see if it's a good idea to go through the toads. The vision shows her hanging from the door of the church by herself, above a host of corpse frogs clamoring for her. We decide to try and hit a frog from the hovercraft, and Emrite fires with her laser pistol. She misses, but the toad turns to face us before deeply croaking and beginning to shuffle towards us. It pulls aggro from 4-5 additional toads.

Rahim shoots at a toad and connects. The toad bellows and speeds up, but they're unlikely to reach us any time soon. Kruti also takes a pistol shot and hits, but it's not enough to kill it. Emrite fires her shear rifle and the toad _unravels_.

She's able to distract the rest of the toads by strategically dismantling a few additional toads, and Rahim drives them up to the church to enter. Emrite fires two additional shots into the floor to create an entrance, and she and Kruti make their way in. They cut a few pipes and conduits, but are able to enter. The pews have all fallen to the floor (previously a wall). The altar is still intact, and appears to be a smaller version of a jeweler's loupe or detective's magnifying glass as the central focus in the room. The lens was massive enough that it bent the stem when the building tipped. A cabinet door hangs open at the front of the altar. There doesn't appear to be anybody else in the church.

They slide down and walk across the mound of wooden pews to the front. The whole place smells like old river water. Inside the altar, they see what was a well-organized series of baskets that have tumbled into one another. It looks like dried dumpling wrappers in the shape of a stick of gum (like communion wafers). An assortment of unbroken vials of clear liquid. The way the light refracts through the liquid immediately shows that it's clear, but not water. In addition, a thick book with brass endcaps and bound in leather. The cover also looks like the lens on the stem. It's about the size of a modern bible. The symbols are ideograms in the pattern and style of the hexogram qr codes on the sarcophagus. There's an 8x20 grid of them on each page, and was handwritten. Each of the vials is capped in a screw top. Kruti takes two vials of the liquid and two of the wafers.

Rahim sees that the toads are fully busy eating the other toads, actively getting in the way of their own progress. They check out a closet and find a cassock with a lens on a stem embroidered into it. Kruti takes a picture of the lens on the altar and the cassock.

We load back up and recover our materials and decide to head back to town with the spoils of our recent adventures.

## 2020-06-20-S -- Session 005 #S005

We turn around and head back downriver, moving faster since we're going with the flow of the river. Carrion birds scatter at the sound of the Gender Neutral's engine, except for a large cloud of them ahead of us. We're fast approaching, and it's near to where we expect to pass by. Enough to notice 10 minutes upriver, taken off as though they were startled by something.

We have the option of going around in shallower waters and less-safe terrain to circumvent the threat and still arrive at Carromir, and we choose to avail ourselves of that option.

Kruti looks to spot things, Emrite helps to secure the towed items, and Rahim pilots the craft back. We end up getting lost anyway, and end up in an orchard full of water and corpses, making jam in the waterways. We end up in Carromir 3 hours later, an extra 2.5 hours on our trip. It's well into the evening, and we're able to navigate into the dark town - lit only by fires on rooftops and such.

We look to use the LAN to ping Max and let him know we'll be coming by. The anthropologists are unloaded, departing without the equipment/"weapons" we took from them. Behavior tries to get a sidearm from us, which we refuse him. Kruti looks back to see him trying to decide whether to use a pipe or rock to attack his compatriot. She suggests he use the pipe.

We depart to meet Max at The Latipan and come across people going through the rubble. We ask them about the children and one offers to help us for payment of food, suggesting that we not offer custody of helpless, "delicious-looking" children to just anyone. He comes back 25 minutes later with Theodore Brozen, the man whose life Emrite saved with the shear rifle. Brozen looks haggard, but strong and tall. A younger, mustached man with a long hunk of wood accompanies him. The kids immediately recognize him and are happy to see him as they're reunited. They lived with his brother, upriver, and washed downriver in the flood. He asks what happened to their parents, and they shake their heads and bury their faces in his midsection. We give then enough to eat for 2 days or so (6 rations), and head to the Latipan.

Max meets us and we tell him about the anthropologists and the children. We also tell him about the sarcophagus and its power supply. This could get the ship into orbit for additional repairs, but also could provide power for 100mi or so without any degredation. He goes to get the captain, who seems intent on using the reactor in the pod without regard for the occupant. We decide to wake him up as best we can and let The Latipan use the power supply to get up to the orbital.

The sarcophagus gets pulled into the ship over 1h30m or so of effort and hauling. It's cleaned and hooked up, and we're ready to wake him. Kruti asks what will happen when we open the casket, and she sees a vision of herself put a giant key in a giant lock in darkness underground, and feels immensely satisfied.

We go through with the revival process, but it goes poorly, and he is vaporized. Turns out, he'd been dead the whole time and the sarcophagus malfunctioned by not reporting errors. We discover a sword and a key in the sarcophagus, and take them. Then, an alarm goes off in the cargo hold. The key thing is radioactive, and has set off alarms. It turns out to be a trivial amount of radiation - like being in the same room as a dental x-ray. Kruti finds key-like grooves and a Terran Mandate QR code imprinted on it. She tinkers with the sarcophagus and creates a shielded sheath for it. The sword is pretty freakin' cool. It's super fucking sharp - she's pretty sure it would carve off portions of the bulkhead of the ship. It's probably monomolecular.

The psychics realize that they both sense the sword accepts psychic effort, and is psi-tech.

We get paid for our efforts thus far (returning with a power source for the ship), and depart for the dam. We come around the bend and see a path towards the dam up a creek towards a cypress tree, and we pilot up it. The tree is knotted with bodies and limbs. At the top, like a bizarre christmas tree star, a corpse - knotted in a tangle - wears a bright necklace of gold and glimmering amber. Emrite retrieves it with telekinesis. It's large, like a chain. It's a tremendous amount of gold. It's worth significant money.

We then merge back on to the main span of water on a new leg of the river. It juts off to the right, further than the eye could see. We managed to skip a significant portion of the river's normal path. We're 15mi from the dam, sealing off a mountain pass. It's enormous. Ahead of us, there is a huge log rising out of the water. There are additional figures on top of the log. There's a hill off to our left (15-20 min) diversion with a crowd of animals on it - a broad mix of different animals.

The tree is a massive root structure exposed in mid-air. On top of the log, fairly close to the water, are three figures. They seem frozen in the middle of some unlikely discovery. One looks shocked. Behind him is a diminutive figure - about the size of a 9yo. Definitely not human, but reddish-brown. Long thin hands, reddish tail, spade-shaped head. One hand in the pocket of the robes of the first figure. Behind that creature is another humanoid non-human figure. Lanky, long-limbed (maybe deliberate genetic manipulation), loincloth/ragged leather, spear in its hands, and rearing back to stab the brown red thing.

Kruti uses her oracular ability to see what happens if we bring the human on the boat and sees armies of the other creatures charging towards each other as she stands on a bruise purple plane of biomatter.

## 2020-27-06-S -- Session 006 #S006

Kruti makes psychic contact with the humanoid and feels panic and hope. They have the image of a brown/black/green rapidly inflating popover-type going right for their face. It's clearly coming out of a knothole on the log they're stuck on.

She asks if they're ok, and she hears deep panic and frustration that they can't answer, and anger since they are trying to move and can't. Emrite attempts to use the weird psychic water weapon on the log near them. If it's working, it's not yet obvious how to make it do whatever it's supposed to do. She is able to lift the woman by her robes and dips her in the river up to her knees, with no results. Kruti detects confusion and panic.

Emrite puts her back on the log. Rahim shouts to ask how we unfreeze them. The thought flashes through their head of worm blood. Eoperapatus Toterogiganticus -- scientifically accurate measurements for what qualifies as worm blood. It's a species of velvet worm that's can grow to 12 ft long.

We depart NE along the river for around 20 min to the now-standard tableau of dead, bloated livestock and carrion birds. There are fields of dead corn rotting in the mire as we come upon a village. As we come through, there are swarms of starlings rolling over us - taking off, flying as we pass, and landing back on the water. We come upon the village, far smaller than Carromir. The buildings have been badly damaged. Structural timbers and chimneys are intact along with second stories, but the first floors are blown away. Every building has 4-6 people sitting on top. They aren't waving at us or anything, and we couldn't hear if they'd be shouting.

We pass closer passing by and notice that they have no supplies. Like, at all. Rahim pings Max on their network to let them know:

```
Bearing
Distance

Max - {Estimated No Refugees} in town at this marker, on rooves, no visible supplies, unlikely to survive without intervention. - Rahim
```

As we're turning the bend, there is a sudden glint of gold under the water. Emrite attempts to lift it with her telekinesis only to get a spike of headache and nearly pull herself out of the boat. We stop the GN and wait for the wake to die down. The glimpse of gold is a heavy layer of silt, and a hand's breadth of highly reflective gold somewhere down there. When we slow down, we also smell the strong and distinct scent of rotting fish (kind of). Sea rot, but freshwater. As overpowering as dropping an entire tray of sushi in a tool shed on a summer day left to spoil. In addition, chunks of shattered crab shell litter the nearby spike of rock. There are no complete crab shells, and glancing at them reveal they're 3" thick in places. We drop a waypoint and continue on.

THE SHATTERED DAM

We approach a gogmagogic structure of black stone - a scale of construction that beggars belief. To look up at it from the base, one must tilt one's head to the limit of upward movement. It's cracked in its center with a cavern of raw stone. Black water tumbles through. The interior reveals an internal structure of rooms and tunnels in the mass of the stone. The method of constructing the entire thing out of a single piece of stone boggles the mind. Nobody makes megastructures like this. It is a remnant of the time before the screen. "The past is a foreign country."

In the crack in the dam, an opening near the bottom is obvious - a large room. The opening itself could fit an entire building. The crack extends below, and the water level is lower. Sharp-edged chunks of black stone is scattered around the bottom of the dam. In addition, 6 sluice gates large enough to admit an oil tanker, are all open. They're gridded so nothing huge can come through, and only a small trickle of water is coming out. Each one has a highly visible polyhedral lock/door. The 5 (excepting the far left) have outlines of a square, diamond, top shape, pentagon, and mutlifaceted triangular shape.

The far left houses a very large figure (humanoid, 15-20ft tall) kneeling in front of the leftmost gate, pressing its head against the lock. Its hands are pressed against the side of the dam, pulling away to show water pushing through against its body. It would be enough force to send a normal human tumbling away at extreme force. It's not human or flesh. It stops pressing itself against the dam and stands up, and the increased water flow doesn't seem to bother it at all. It picks up one of the giant chunks of black rock and places it up against another. They knit together like dropped pottey. We maybe come up to its knee. When it moves, plates move across its body. There is a pyramid indentation on the sluice, perfectly matched to the face of the golem-like creature.

It slowly (like tired or injured) begins walking directly towards the GN. Kruti reaches out towards the golem and makes some sort of contact. She gets a sense of tremendous sadness and exhaustion, as though up for 36hrs with more business to tend to and a tedious task ahead. When it recognizes our presence, the sadness vanishes like a dropped cup and is replaced with a routine analysis of the GN and its passengers with the purpose of rending everything to pieces.

Kruti calls out to it to tell it that we're there to help, intuitively speaking a language that the creature speaks - one similar to Mandate Standard like Old English is to English. It responds, out loud, in a voice that booms so loudly that it ripples the water. "GRIEVOUS DAMAGE REPAIRS ARE NECESSARY. ALL MATERIALS AVAILABLE ARE VALID. ALL PERSONELL IMMEDIATELY RETURN TO ATTEND TO EXIGENT EVENTS. YOU ARE COMPELLED." Kruti asks where we are to report, and it pauses, turns to pick up chunk of black stone the size of a tractor tire, looks at the dam and back at us, and says "I'M VERY {HUNGRY/TIRED/EXHAUSTED}." Kruti responds that she understands, and that we're looking to help, asking what it eats. It looks down at the stone and back at the leftmost sluice. "HYDROELECTRIC POWER MUST BE RESTORED. REPAIRS NECESSITATE RESTORATION OF HY... HY... HY..." and trails off. "CONTAINMENT FAAAAAIIIILU...." Kruti suggests returning to its dock to recharge. "INSUFFICIENT POWER DRAW. ALTERNATIVE NECESSARY." Kruti suggests it can't have our craft, since we need more reinforcements. "YOUR REQUEST HAS BEEN DENIED DUE TO THE CHAIN OF COMMAND." Kruti suggests it halt or be decommissioned, and it instead picks up speed. "IT IS A CAPITAL OFFENSE TO FIRE ON EVEN A REPRODUCTION OF AN OVERSEER. LOWER YOUR WEAPON."

Rahim is able to skirt around it and get closer to the dam. "OVERSEER HARANANA REMAINS IN SEQUESTRATION. IN HIS ABSENCE, THE SIX UNDERSEERS ARE THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY IN THIS INSTALLATION. YOU SPEAK TO UNDERSEER ALNITAK." Kruti says we have news about Haranana, and it pauses. If it continues to pursue us, it'll be forced to respond. It's frozen in place for a moment. The conversation takes a turn, and it begins marching towards us again. Emrite responds with the shear rifle. It typically disassembles things, rendering them completely useless. This time, a few bits fall off and a fine coating of dust flit off, and it appears to be highly resistant to pretech weapons. Rahim increases the distance between us to roughly 100m, hoping to gauge its max speed. It instead hurls a ~400-lb chunk of black rock towards us. It hits, and we take significant damage and are lucky we have seatbelts.

Emrite misses with the shear rifle, and Rahim disengages. Kruti tries to cut the rock on board with the saber, which goes poorly. We discuss our options until we notice someone waving a flaring torch at us, near a copse of trees. There is a trickle of smoke coming from there and a man in rags with a torch. As we approach, his hoarse voice shouts "I need help." As we approached, a swarm of zombies began raking at our vessel and clamoring to board.

## 2020--S -- Session 007 #S007

There's space for the three of us, one more person/gear comfortably, and a final person/gear uncomfortably. 7 forms emerge out of the water, and each one appears to have a glowing red light on the back of their necks. Emrite unleashes a burst of shear rifle fire, but fires high and hits the treeline. Rahim manages a tight spin with the Gender Neutral and spins off several of the creatures. He then draws his laser pistol. Kruti attacks with her psychic saber, slicing one in half.

Two attack Emrite, who shoots one in the head and avoids the other. Rahim speeds through the group and puts some distance between the group and the zombies. Kruti strikes at the remaining zombie and misses as we hit a rock. She strikes the GN, causing damage. The ship is now over half damage, and speed is halved. By the light of the sparking console, we can see that these are drowning victims, bloated and dead.

The clinger climbs aboard. Emrite moves to get a bit of breathing room. Rahim shoots the new arrival, and Kruti kills both in a single strike of the badass saber.

We continue on our way back to Carromir as Kruti and Emrite begin to look at the tech embedded in the zombies. They appear to be fractal PCBs, attached with fiberoptic filaments through to the brain and spine. As we're heading back past the sunken bridge, and almost immediately, something large starts rising out of the water. Like a dome, directly behind us. In the dark, it looks wider than the GN is long and regularly stippled on the top. The dome rises up and 6 multijointed limbs, wrap around the corpses, and jerk it all under the water. The dome then sinks back down under the water. We nope out of there and head back to the Latipan. We're able to repair overnight as others sleep, and crash for the night.

**DAY BREAK**

Things have improved significantly, and can purify and crack water. Lots of welding and such going on. We go to Captain Zarathusa with the zombie weave and information on the dam. We discuss the dam, the GN, the animals on the hill, and zombies. She's seen this tech before - colonial seed technology. It takes any silicates in the soil and uses whatever it can to build basic transponders. It looks like tech used to build something with no human interaction, like an evolutionary neural network. Looks like someone planted one in the back of someone's head. We're offered cash to bring back whoever's doing it.

## 2020--S -- Session 008 #S008

We get our shit together, including rope, climbing gear, and binoculars, and head out towards the dam again. We intend to ditch the GN.

There are several long, fat-faced fish circling the GN. The fishfinder reveals 14 40-lb fish clustered around the GN. Eventually, Kruti stabs one, and they go into a frenzy.

Rahim pulls Kruti away from the frenzy as they jump out of the water against the ship, impacting "like a wet bag thrown by an idiot." Kruti strikes, but doesn't make significant contact. Emrite fires a burst with the shear rifle, but also doesn't make significant contact, either. They leap out at Kruti and Rahim, dealing damage.

Rahim stabs two, killing them. Kruti tries to punch a fish with the fish on her arm, failing but killing the attached fish. Emrite used rope to kill 4 fish at once with a telekinetic rope trick. The fish attack Rahim heavily, bringing him down to 5/20.

Rahim cannot bring his knife to bear. Kruti accidentally hits Rahim instead of a fish. Emrite knocks two fish off, but doesn't clear Rahim. Rahim is nearly killed, but Emrite intervenes with psionics.

The fish are taken care of in the following turn, and we high-tail it back to Carromir for rest and recovery.

## 2020-07-18-S -- Session 009 #S009

We hired 2 people at 30 (3rd-level or so). They'll go to the dam but not inside, and will be paid half before and half after to guard the GN roughly 2-4 days. We get Douglas and Emma Harris, a married couple. Emrite asks a barrage of questions, which Douglas reluctantly answers.

Emrite tries to access the zombie device, and finds that the code was definitely written by another machine - it's written with no regard for human readability or maintenance. The battery inside is just enough to coherently animate limbs and conduct electrical signals through nerves - only animating limbs, not internal organs or anything. A final code module takes audio input, but not output.

The device is beginning to break apart, like amateurish or very cheaply made hardware. The onboard-memory for the device is extremely small.

We're able to climb up to the lowest room, which looks like a modern-day hospital room. There is another room on the other side that we couldn't see from the ground. We're rougly 1/4 of the way up, and this is roughly 90% up. The room we're in now is post-/pre-tech, more advanced than the 21st-century-limited colony.

We see enterprise shelving, stairs up, and a gap with serial ports with cables ripped free. It looks like where the sarcophagus may have been. A portrait above it appears to survive. The doors to the stairs up are bowed out from this side, suggesting water impact from in here. A space above those doors show stainless steel spikes dropped from the ceiling. No socket in the floors are there to accept them, and they're bent towards the stairs. They look deliberately sharpened.

The painting is a modern painting, placed on the wall with a covering. A few droplets of water have collected on the opposite side, suggesting it's not a perfect seal -- just a dust cover. The painting isn't a style seen in the past, but is meant to mimic things like egyptian heiroglyphs - the depiction of pharoahs and such. Not exactly - an homage. A crowned figure held a branching key and an iron sword. They chop off the heads of pale, starved people, who are crawling towards him offering heaps of gold ingots.

King with key hand burns alive race with dark skin and white hair.

King bathed in sunlight releasing water, drowning figures doing field work or manual labor, covered in darkness.

While holding relics discovered with Haranana, the figure looks archtypal, and difficult to pin to a single person. The peoples look subjugates as fuck. They don't look like the figures frozen on the log. We snap a photo with our dataslabs.

The flashlights on our suits show something glimmering in the room beyond the doors, and a sound like a servo or mechanism chugging. Emrite moves forward to see what's happening. She sees another argon crypt with a badly rotted corpse hanging halfway out. There's an armature holding the crypt, able to support the full weight. In the corner, badly smashed up, is a
group of robot dogs. One leg is repeatedly trying to walk, while the rest of it slowly dies... D:

Emrite tells us what she saw and that it's safe to come up, and we do. She wants to hack the sarcophagus and dog to gather information and figure things out. With more light, we see that there are more oil paintings on the walls in here. There's also another door. It looks virtually identical to the previous door, but with no deployed spikes. It doesn't look like it's been bowed in and breached.

The painting is of the same king. The crown is done in the same pigment as the fire from the previous painting, a yellowish-white. Here, he gives charity - stacks of gold and grain to stacks of people. He's surrounded by what looks like admirers and standing in front of ranks of troops with rifles and dog-drones at their feet.

Emrite tries to hack the sarcophagus first. This crypt is much smaller than the others, with significant conduit going into the structure of the dam itself. The sarcophagus says that this is the body of Embato Haranana... :O It says that he has died from an unplanned sealant breach. Catastrophic seal breach around when the place was bombed. The interment date matches the other sarcophagus. The bioscanner assumed room temperature around the time of the dam's damage. However, the warning light says that we're not scanning a person. Emrite uses her telekinesis to crack into it, and there's no skeleton or organs. After thorough scanning, this thing is made of biotissue on the outside with a cartilaginous structure inside. It's meat and biological, but no way it was ever alive.

She also hacks into a dog robot. They have railgun armitures attached to their backs. Kruti is able to take one off and store it for use on the GN, probably. Emrite tries to figure out what their purpose was, etc. They're very heavy and have a decent amount of armor. They're military drones. The files on them suggest that they're sentry drones in a charging cradle, since they have maintenence runtimes and were scanning their patrol area - this room. She checks to see if there's anything else in the sarcophagus, and there isn't. She tries to hack into the dam through the consoles, and gets:

Catastrophic damage sustained, lockdown protocol in effect, isolated circuits only

The sarcophagus has long-term preservation data, with logs back to the time it was interred. Vitals indicate normal life signs, all within the normal parameters. All suggests that this was an actual person. Emrite pushes the door open.

When the doors are opened, there is the crackling snap of the sudden discharge of a very high-voltage capacitor - followed repeatedly by the ping of metal spikes hitting the space immediately in front of the metal door. The space beyond is another stairway - similar to this room. This one goes to the ceiling with a trapdoor. The base is set flush with the floor above it. The doors are apparently capable of being secret. Hm.

Emrite floats a drone up into the next room. The walls are more or less plastered with warnings of danger of electromagnetic/ionizing radiation. Beyond this point, you risk severe energetic discharge damage. Threat to person, mental capacities, magnetic tapes, storage, and quantum entanglement personality cores. There are 8 humanoid robots in the room wearing what looks like significant armor plating. They're set into charging cradles, but the seams making up their component parts are leaking battery corrosion. The hatch is in the left-front side of the room. The room, however, is dry. Between the 4 on the left and 4 on the right is a heavy steel plate set into the floor at an angle.

Kruti has a vision of going up to pass through the room and it doesn't go well. We turn back and decide to head up through the crack in the dam to the room we saw from the first room we entered, and end here.

## 2020-07-25-S -- Session 010 #S010

We make it into the room, torn open by the cataclysmic damage dealt to the dam. This was some kind of server room - racks mounted to the walls with smashed and waterlogged server banks. One door on the opposite side is a security door with electromagnetic locks, etc. It has been sheared clear off of the door frame and lies in a puddle of water. Beyond the doorway are a set of stairs towards a room of similar size.

The stairs descend into a room that is somehow still flooded. Kruti happens to have glowbugs! The next room is 15x15, and the water is 3ft deep. A lot of debris is floating around, but also larger chunks that look like actual objects. In the center of the room, on a pedestal, is a model of the dam itself in cutaway, showing the inner workings.

We see in the model that we are in a secret area of the dam, walled off from the normal facility. We find a door built into the wall. Emrite telekinetically clears the room of water. In doing so, we find a number of objects that don't look like debris. There are six distinct objects - about the scale of an action figure or barbie doll. One looks like the underseer robot, and 5 other models. They're not posable. Their heads are polyhedra that match and are scaled to fit the sluice gates on the model. We position them in and push them into the gates on the model. They fit in perfectly, and have an extremely satisfying click. We hear the clunk of an EM lock disengaging. The door on the wall slides open., revealing a short flight of stairs leading down. The floor still has about 1/8th of an inch of water, and some trickles down the new staircase.

We hear the thrum of high-voltage electronics. As we look down, there is a soft glow as lights on the ceiling and walls illuminate. 6 sarcophagi are mounted to the wall and heavily braced, secured to the walls. Each one is an argon preservation crypt, but the front face on each one is unique and personalized. One has a large, tiki-like face; another is a photorealistic koi; another is a cloaked figure; another is an exposed, pirouetting nervous system; another is an offset solar orb radiating beams; etc. Worked into each unique faceprint is a bread window showing the lit interiour. They're all significantly larger than Haranana's, 2'x5'. Humanoid figures lie in each one. In the center of the room is some kind of robot or robotic figure. It's as baroque and unique as any of the crypts. It looks like a significant amount of server storage is on the back, armored with a crenelated military-style casing. There's a faint shimmer in the light that reminds us of high-end body armor, and is plated in it. The rest looks vaguely humanoid, crouching down and gripping its knees in such a way that it looks like a desk. It has been constructed to look simultaneously like a kneeling servant and the seat and desktop of a computer terminal. In its chest lies a dark screen. Finally, the back wall of the room (dam-forward) is a single panel of reinforced metal with a hole in the center - an aperture for a large key.

All of the engineers are here, and their names are holographically displayed on the windows into their cripts. They hold an electronic cube in their hands that is still lit and working, with a fiber-optic like going into the corner of their eyeball. To access them, we'd have to open the external latch. Upon approach, the computer creature opens its chest and it turns into a sit-down computer console. It is built sharply, but is ergonomically accessible. Its head lights up and it regards us, but doesn't speak. Emrite asks for a status update. It pauses, and then reads out a bunch of QR code-like writing that we've seen before. Rahim is able to confirm it's the same set of symbols found in the bible. Emrite remembers that she was able to feed Haranana's diary into her compad, and we work out a rough translation program.

The robot provides an extremely formal greeting, along with a description of a process and a warning. In part, it's precious information, don't distribute it; in another part, it's dangerous information, be careful with it.

We get it to the next page using gesture controls. It's another set of warnings about the importance of security and how right now, the reader is participating in the security process of this information. Lots of emphasis on respect for one's tools, and some kind of gloss between the identity of the worker and the personification of the tools they're using. At the end of the long and difficult-to-translate passage, it ends with a clear and specific description of the process it's meant to complete. At then end, we'd understand how to create our own turbine robot. It's described as a turbine construct, embodied creation, possessed of the creator's intelligence and functionally indestructible so long as it retains its power source.

We try to get Alnitak's current status verbally, but it doesn't work. We try to put it in on the keyboard, but they're apparently holographic representations, so Rahim takes a seat and starts to type into the console. The metal is extremely cold and unpleasant. It looms over him, extremely sharp and threatening.

Emrite plugs into a sarcophagus and finds that the inhabitant is biologically dead, dated within 30s of being interred in every case. However - metabolic, cardiac, and pulmonary functions ceased, but all continue to have uninterrupted brainwave functions. She tries to pull the data from the dataline from the sarcophagus. Applying a line shunt cracks the line, and Emrite enters to search it. The device is a quantum entanglement device, used for the creation of virtual intelligences.

Emrite asks: Who are you?, but gets no response. The cubes are powered on a geologic time scale.

We want to figure out where the underseers are, and NODE 008 is unable to help with anything that's not physically connected to this installation. An additional fact we do learn is that there's no information going into the VI core. That line is dead, suggesting they were pulled and uploaded.

Asking for location on SITE_2 gives us a single ideogram. The ideogram expresses that this is the most sensitive information on this system. Are you absolutely sure you want to bring this up? Y

It shows a topographical map. Several miles to the NW, it pings a location. It's at the bottom of a significant depression in the landscape. We figure out that it recognizes us as users, and requires physical access. It's either to be used as designed (in-person), or you are not authorized. We find out that we're able to turn off hazards for mainetenance, but must justify it in natural language.

We exit and head to the top of the opposite side of the dam and see miles off. We can see the hill with animals, Carromir, giant swamp cyprus, windmill, other villages, and far in the distance is the sideways church, etc. In the other direction, we can see much more.

There are 3 sets of lights heading towards Carromir, like lanterns. The smallest one is by the church, and the two others are by the dam and an hour away from the dam.

On the other side of the dam is a soundless vista that stinks like an airless tomb in the light of an unwanted sun. We look out across a vast wilderness of rainbow-colored weeds drooping from strange branching floors of the previously drenched land. Overhead, on the valley sides, there are rich bandings of many-shaded stone. The walls of this valley, even then covered in water until weeks ago, gleam very strangely. The sides have snatches of mirror-bright sections, like a shattered disco ball. The floor looks nothing like the valley floor we came from; it's a blue-grey mud. In the silence is worming movement. Things are shifting in the distance, miles away. It's awkward to view, like a sheet pulled off a naked corpse. At the far end of the valley is the steaming thing, an enormous wound in the earth - a pit through which a tremendous pillar of steam is pouring off.

The movement is happening all over the dam. Emerging from the pool of water are strange, pale, amphibian-like creatures. Smaller than people. One, slightly larger and bedecked in a headdress or cloak, waves a length of wood or metal and gesturing at the trees, further to the west. Maybe 100 of them emerging from the pool. Carved in the rock on all sides are 100s or 1000s of carved curves, reflecting the sunlight in strange and interesting ways. They're all essentially similar. The rock has been cut and polished or have had smooth ceramic walls polished to a sheen. In front of many of them is a pit or hole, and inside are waterlogged flood lights in the same sort of style as the dam we're currently in. Every one of them faces towards and focuses on the pit where the steam is emerging. There appears to be a footpath from the dam to the pit. A series of bridges leading across the landscape that used to be underwater. The closest one is a white mound, then golden brown, then harsh matte black. Along the way is a small hamlet of golden houses. There's a hive along the way with some sort of activity, and then the steaming pit. The pit is surrounded by 8 tall towers(?) like prisons have towers on the edges of the walls. Mounds of dead fish form new geography with piles of their bodies scattered around the floor.

\*\*\* Is it built out of the same black "rock" the overseer was hurling? Y

**_ Fuckin' Sidebars _**

Telekinesis through a microscope: If it fxs solely on perception, neat. But if now, how difficult would it be to hone that skill to that level? Makes me think of Invincible exercising his flight in the comics to prepare for fighting the other viltrumites.

How much of our brains do we share?

## 2020-08-02-N -- Session 011 #S011

We radio down to our hirelings and receive no answer on the channel. They may have made off with our craft or could be hiding out now. There are lights moving across the river valley, and a new landscape from under the dam. We expect creatures to arrive within an hour. We opt to examine the door. Kruti is able to feel the telepathic presense of the underseer she made contact with days ago, and he's an option for defense if we need him. We decide to examine the large door.

We're on top of the dam itself and are looking at a tremendous vault-style door built into the rock wall of the valley. It's large enough to fit The Latipan in sideways if we could open it. There are no observation ports or other holes for anything to come out of. No portcullis, no moat, just a clean swath of dam up to a vault door. Kruti knocks and may as well be knocking on the mountain.

Rahim tries to identify the amphibious creatures, and realizes they bear a resemblence to the small creatures we saw frozen on the log. The floor of the now-exposed area looks like Kruti's vision.

The stairs down lead to the level and then below and into the gathering pool behind the dam. Kruti thinks to look to the portion of the dam where we would expect to find a door based on the model. She approaches to check closely, and is able to find a secret door. It's so well-hidden, it's expected that we never would've been able to find it had we not known it was there. The door won't budge or respond to line shunts, and must be significantly heavy.

Counting the number of folks arriving, the first group likely holds around 8-10 people in it, carrying a lantern or some other light. They bob as though in a watercraft (split between 2 crafts), and are in two separate group. About an hour behind them is a second group moving at the speed of a watercraft, roughly the same size.

Kruti establishes telepathic contact with the amphibious creature in the headdress. There is a surprisingly complex bouquet of emotions coming from the target. The righteous fury of a soldier about to lead others into battle - not brute tribalism, but a precise mind and considered approach. Thought about why they feel this way. Intensity of emotions suggests a nuanced belief honed to a precise conclusion.

Her telepathy translates what it's saying to its people: "Must nature always be asked to straighten out the mess that man has made?!"

The creature she tries to encroach on has a robust enough mind to fend off telepathic contact.

Kruti informs the others of the result. After some discussion of what to tell him after making contact, she opts to inform them of the approaching forces (?) by showing him images of the approaching lights. It slows down its gestures for a moment, now just as (if not more) fervent as before. They're no going directly for the golden structures. Kruti sends an additional message and gets a response in picture-perfect Mandate Common: "Even now, the iniquities of those from beyond our ancestral home continue to plague us. You are not welcome in my mind, among my people, or in my homeland. Begone! Plague us no more in this, our hour of reprisal."

Kruti asks for elaboration. Usually, people communicate in half-interpretable dreams and such. This creature communicates cleanly, like text off a page. "Diplomacy in the moment of war is an unusual encounter. Were this any other hour and our home not stripped bear by the degredations of those like you, I would wecome you into our kraysh, I would feed you our finest foods, and I would entertain you as the chief I am. But this is our final hour, and the Reed People will be made to suffer so long as we draw breath."

Kruti communicates gratitude that he answered at all, and shares the vision of his people and who they were at war with. Yes, the Reed People of the golden domes have long been our ancestral foes. But today I will claim what is rightfully mine. But today I will claim revenge in victorious battle that which is rightfully mine against Actun Degrange. You are too late. It is inevitable. Those that breath only air will pick the flesh from our bones in days. Whether they fly or climb the walls around us. If we don't get revenge against them now, we'll die forever having never found it."

We decide to wait and look out. The first group arrives in canoes and checks their armaments. There are 7 of them, armed with laser pistols and machetes. Flashlights are distributed, and they begin looking for a way up the crevice of the dam. They're not walking with their weapons out, and are wearing normal casual clothing. They pick their way through the scattered rocks, guiding each other up the interior crevice of the dam.

They talk about getting the jars (overseers)

The second craft arrives, delayed. Rahim steps away from the tent to get a better look. All of the amphibians have marched away to the back of the dam. This looks like another group of Carromir villagers, except we recognize some voices. Among them, we recognize the voice of Theodore Brosen. He also sees a few people dressed in what look like pale white robes with a device on their front like the iconography of the tipped over church. They get out of their makeshift watercraft - a skiff and canoe - 7 strong. They huddle much closer. They're trying to be quiet, and huddle together. The two robed figures pull out what looks like a Nalgene bottle, and pour in liquid from another vessel. They then take out a stick of gum or some such into the vessel. Within about 10 seconds, the Nalgene is glowing with light blue light, stronger than the flashlights from earlier. They use them as light sources, carefully picking their way forward. They begin to make their way up towards the entrance and the first group. They're armed with table legs and staves.

This is when we hear a gut-churning, loud metallic BANG. It wakes us all up...

-- GAME CUT SHORT --

## 2020-08-08-S -- Session 012 #S012

We awake to the bang and try the hidden door. There's no change, and it's still immovable. We decide to wait and see what happens. Kruti looks over the edge and is able to hear a few second order echoes and some laser fire. After a few minutes, it dies down... before abruptly picking back up again. Now it's shouts, ringing out in alarm and anger. Now much clearer sounds of heavy impacts, heavy footfalls, and laser fire. Abruptly, from below us, four people spill out of the breach in the wall at a full sprint. One leaps out of the side into the water, falling down and bouncing off rocks. More sprint as fast as they can go, falling painfully several times. We hear additional heavy metallic footfalls, but nothing else comes out of the dam. A new voice rings we've never heard before rings out from the structure of the dam below, not in a language we speak. It sounds like a pitch-shifted dial-up internet connection. It's a harsh and grating basso screech of digital tones.

We decide to go to Node 8 and consult it to see the differences. We notice that the people who survived fleeing have left, leaving 2 canoes and an outrider watercraft, and a man dead in the pool below. We traverse over to Node 8 and ask for a list of nodes.

```

Requesting information on the newly tripped nodes, and see that NODE 002 activates 5s before NODE 005.

Rahim tries to dig deeper into NODE 011, like what it is and how to access it. It takes roughly an hour to sift through the information. We come to the conclusion that there's a hierarchy of intensity for security, and that that hierarchy starts on the right and ascends to the left, making NODE 011 the highest priority of security. We also get a header that this is highly priveleged information, like SITE_002. After decoding some mutually self-referential ideograms (not a simple language), we learn that this language can't be pronounced with a human throat - but was never meant for a human throat to pronounce. We figure out that NODE 011 is identified as the true purpose of the entire dam facility. The purpose is not to provide hydroelectric power; the majority was used to power the underseers mortal forms, in service of protecting the entities in NODE 011 under radiological lock and key. These things are not referred to as bacteria or disease, but as a group of individuals. It seems like they're using an internal system to refer to these things - TYPHON Specimens (TYPHON is a classification rather than a label). A cognitohazard - something that is dangerous to perceive.

Two Additional Facts:
001: There is only 1 key to the sealing mechanism for the TYPHON Specimen, and it is a precisely calibrated radiologic artifact.
002: Further research at at the collection site at SITE 002 is pending.

We can reset NODE 002, but note NODE 004. Upon checking, NODE 004 has apparently reset itself.

We pack up and head out to find that there was a battle on the other side. There are gouges in the walls, scorch marks from lasers (probably), and lots of blood. Further in, there's a body wearing worker's clothing. They've been torn in half by raw force, staring at the neck/shoulders and continues down to the pelvis. We loot him and find a laser pistol! As Emrite picks it up, she notices that there are too many hands in this pile of person. There's an extra hands. The extra hand is nearly skeletonized and mangled. Kruti takes a look and finds out that it's not just mangled - it's digested. The soft tissues are gone, and it's all bone and thick tendons. It's been sitting in someone's stomach for a while. Additionally, it's around the lower torso of this person. It's likely that they've eaten the hand. It's super gross. She ages it as a prepubescent hand. We hear no movement, but dripping liquid. In the following rooms, we find 10 other shredded bodies. 2 are wearing the white robes, and we find a scattering of laser pistols, table legs, and belaying pins. In the final room, where the robots were,
about 5 of the bodies lie. All 8 of the corroded bots look exactly the same - but are now soaked in human viscera and gore. Additionally, the strike plate is occupied by a ram, occupying the full width and breadth of the ram. After the head, it tapers with enough room for someone to uncomfortably fit behind and into the machinery. She calls us in.

We look in and find that the room feels much smaller with the ram down, and it looks like the ram caught someone, accounting for the final body. Although the robots don't appear to have moved, there are clumps of hair caught in them and stuff. The passage behind the ram is fairly large, but badly caked with industrial grease.

Emrite is able to siphon off a bunch of the grease and put it in a corner. We're able to make our way up the shaft. Our flashlights eventually play over a very strange-looking room. Everything we've seen so far has been very industrial and utilitarian. This room is elaborately decorated, and the floor is a mosaic of black and white tiles. They're 4' x 4' squares. The ceiling above each of the white tiles is a brown, metallic boss of a distorted humanoid face making a blowing expression. Each of those has a clearly visible metal tube between its lips. Around the edges of the room, on each of the black tiles, are upright chest-high black ceramic cylinders. They look to be 3' x 5' with flat bottoms and a clearly separate piece settled on top of them. At the far side of the room is a very small antechamber - 4' x 4' - with stairs leading up beyond.

Kruti goes to step in and has a vision of the stone falling through and plummeting her into a pit, a bunch of LEDs turning on, and a whirring of mechanical objects. She has Emrite push the panel instead, breaking it into the pit. Below, we see dozens of dinner-plate sized roomba-like robots. Emrite taps one with a ball of grease and a couple of yellow LEDs pop up on it, along with all the others. They whirr, and a feathery movement around them. They bounce off each other and keep moving around the room. They hum away for a while. Emrite tries a black square we would've tried. We try floating a compad down to get a look at the floor and find that the remainder of the floor is well-reinforced.

We cross without further incident and find the vault door to the outside, open it, and close it again, knowing it's there. We turn back and experiment with a canister on the checkboard, finding that it's full of atrocious poison or disease of some kind. We continue back further and recover 3 more laser pistols. We then depart to go back to the GN.

As we go along, we see a flicker of movement through the trees of something big, hear a large splash of water, and a wet tearing sound. We hear it again in roughly 30s. Kruti throws a rock elsewhere to distract it, and we both hear and see something very large (like construction equipment), start laboriously trudging in the direction that the rock was thrown. The small trees nearby just collapse between it and the direction of the rock. It plods along at roughly 1/3 the speed of a grown person. It gets close enough that it pops up over the trees, and we see the UR overseer. It has an 8-sided stone mounted where its face would be, and is at least as big as Alnitak was, but is moving much slower. It stops and slowly turns its entire upper torso towards the three of us before rumbling out an address in a voice similar to but not identical to Alnitak.

"What do you revere?"

Kruti looks past to see what looks like a bowl created by thrashing and crushing. In the bowl are drowned bodies ripped apart and scattered around. Kruti tries to read its mind, and finds that it's like pushing her hand through a pile of wet loam. It's waiting for us to say 'revelation'.

Kruti responds, "Revelation."

It does nothing for a long moment before leaning back away from us and heading back to the depression it ground into the flooded earth. It plops down into a meditative posture. As it prostrates itself, it kicks up mud, debris, and mangled limbs before ripping open another body and repeating. It's sad and desparate.

We continue back to where we expect to find the GN and find that something is immediately amiss - it's halfway drifted out of the bower, and is no longer well-hidden. Getting closer, we see two upsetting things:

001 - There is some kind of rod or piece of rebar, like 50" long, sticking out of the main control console of the GN with charring around the entry point, with fletching at the end.

002 - A second arrow of similar size is sticking out of the unmoving body of Douglas Harris, slumped over deck of the GN.

A bioscan suggests that they died 14-16 hours ago. The arrow is about the thickness of a Ticonderoga pencil, and doesn't appear to actually be made of metal - it seems like it's actually some kind of plastic. We try Emma by radio. After a few minutes, we don't get a response. We do, however, hear faint radio feedback. About 80 ft away, we find the radio, a dropped rifle, and no body. There's a considerable population of bootprints there. There is a confusion of scrapes and bootprints, and a spatter of blood. There are two sets of bootprints that head off to the dam. One of them is unlike anything we've seen before, and the other matches Emma's boots. They have a shorter gait leaving. The unknown set of footprints doesn't appear to have been bleeding.

We debate briefly over fixing the GN or finding Emma Harris. We look at the damage and find that it has been expertly fucked. Despite the small size, the GN has 1 HP remaining.

## 2020-08-15-S -- Session 013 #S013

Carromir religious is secular reverence of the initial ship arriving. More of a rejection of new tech than embracing something else. Burial is very practical, often individually cultural. We take Harris's personal effects and rifle, finding that his rifle had its safety on and no round ready in the chamber. We bury him and mark his grave.

We make our way back into the dam for spare parts using Emrite as a telekinetic engine. It takes us about two hours. As we approach the dam, we hear the chirp of a radio on the right-hand bank. There, we see the recognizable jacket of Emma Harris. On an attached string, we see a comlink. Emrite brings it over with telekinesis, and it's tuned to a specific open channel. When it gets closer, there is a thumb-pad-sized smear of blood on the case. She says "Hello." A voice we've never heard - ever - responds. A woman, anywhere between young 20s and late 40s, responds: "Hello. Thank you for answering our call. We have your employee, and some requests for us, if we'd like to get her back alive. We are a number of interested parties involved in what's going on with the dam. We've noticed your progress up to this point, are impressed by your tenacity, and would like to cut a deal with you. Interests aren't aligned, but could be."

"What are your interests?"

"Right now, we're interested in having you call of your search. Go back to Carromir and wait there for rescue. Wait a week for signal to get out."

"We crash landed here."

"We know. We'd like to give you a way off this planet. We'll provide a way for you to leave if you stop searching for the observatory. Just go home."

"So you're confirming that it exists."

"We all know it exists. Only one person can gain access, and my employer wants it to be his interests. Go back to town, do whatever it is you need to do, and we'll guarantee a way off-planet in a week's time. And we'll return Emma Harris alive and well."

"What about her husband?"

"Dead."

"Why kill him?"

"Because if we hadn't, he might've tried to stop us from damaging your hovercraft. Would you like to talk to her?"

The channel fills with a bloodcurdling scream of agony, not in the voice of the woman talking.

She gives us a bit of time to discuss. Emrite disables the tracking capabilities on the compad. Emrite hacks it and finds that the other end is on top of the dam.

We agree to head back to Carromir and they agree to drop Emma Harris off at the edge of town and let us know where she is. We're fully lying, of course, but we obviously don't tell them that.

## 2020-08-22-S -- Session 014 #S014

We begin to head back to Carromir. It's uneventful, and takes us 3 hours. We pass by familiar landmarks and arrive back at Carromir. We decide to go back to the Latipan. We spent considerable time discussing flipping the ship.

We've proven ourselves to be reasonable, reliable people. We're her best allies on the ground. We can speak fairly plainly with each other. We explain we have the means to right the ship. The crux of it is that this can't be the last ride of the ship because she owes money on it and it's their means of survival. We discuss things that we can DC reduced, +1 for assist, and we succeed!

We Want:
Transport and cover while we confirm Site 002, and get us off planet with the GN.

They Offer:
Transport, high buzz of Site 002. They need to get off planet, and don't want to risk combat or farting out in atmo.

1. Holes in buildings
   Rahim solves with Talk!

2. Shear rifle speed & accuracy. Preprogram a firing solution.
   Kruti solves with Fix! Emrite solves with Hack!

IT WORKS! We do it, and the ship rights itself. Emrite never has to Impact Sump, and Captain Zarathusa offers us jobs. We politely deflect, and start preparing to leave.

We hear the rumble of the engines igniting, and then the microfusion plant begins to whine. We take off nearly immediately, and are basically ballistically thrust off the planet. We expect to have left an exit crater. After a moment, we hit a high cruising altitude. We have minimal time, and Captain orders the Site 002 buzz. Comms officer will use ship's array to answer questions. We'll get reasonably high-res photos. We see Site 002 and it's a pit with 60-ft towers surrounding it. They're huge, black metal towers with parabolic mirrrors with searchlight-sized lamps focused on them. The mirrors are aligned and projecting active light into the center of the pit. There's a ramp of asphalt leading down from the edge of the pit into the center. Though everything else is still wet from being underwater, the area inside the site is completely dry. There are no shadows inside the pit. It's so illuminated by the towers surrounding and the light reflected from all nearby mirrors, the deepest part of the pit is visible. There we see a massive, opened vault door. The door itself is caked in mud, dead bottom-feeding lake growth, and the area beyond is untouched by the surrounding mess. Beyond the door, human-scaled steps.

We ask for:

1. 3D map - 10-20m
   Officer sounds the pulse array, trying to get a map. It's definitely not normal soil, and couldn't penetrate far. We find out the stairs lead down at least 100m into the earth.
2. geology
   Most of the surrounding area is limestone. Underground caverns, water moving. It's definitely not limestone - may as well be solid stone. All bounce, no data. Only reason we got the shaft was because we were directly overhead. It's unnaturally dense. Looks like material the dam was made of.

Captain gives the command to go into orbit, and we tip back. We breach orbit and are greeted with the sight of the Chalcidony rings surrounding Hartoom. We see the massive, gently rotating structure of the Holy Derelict, in a mild cruise from where we are. The entire crew lets out a relieved sigh. Captain begins giving commands, and we begin to move towards the Derelict. We begin approaching.

We dock at the Derelict and find ourselves again on civilized ground. This is the last rest stop before any of the further systems in the sector. Captain disembarks to resupply. She'll be here about a week for repairs. The whole crew owes us a favor. Spot on the crew is always good, but we also have a favor in our pockets. She departs to get `questionably` drunk. They give us their comm codes and depart for an onboard bar.

We send a message to Vonketosen and squat in the Latipan.

Terran Mandate Technical Manual Speech, a high-density medium for compressing content. It goes through a robotic scanner. Afterwards, we get a summary of the contents from an AI. It's a copy of a copy of a copy. Even though people were careful, it's full of errors and strange delivery. It's a story of two brothers, one dark and evil calling upon hidden powers in his struggle. The good brother battled the bad, and finally locked him away with a seal of water. We get 2000c for it.

The message sent back is text only, but is roughly 50MB.

We get a strange debt collection email back WRT Vonketosen, insinuating we all

We also get a message that is just a subject line:

## 2020--S -- Session 015 #S015

We do a bunch of trading and purchasing. We repair the GN, Rahim gets a laser rifle in exchange for two laser pistols and some credits, and some extra A Cells. Kruti and Emrite get grenades, some additional armaments, and tools. We also

## 2020-09-05-S -- Session 016 #S016

We return to the statue room and descend into the pit. The pit is a bit translucent, and the reflections are slightly odd. Kind of milky. Near the edge of the light about 50 ft further is a foot, attached to something messy and neither alive nor moving. We approach the lumpy, collapsed shape, sending a glowbug down the hallway as we get close. It's got at least 1 boot attached. At one point, it was a person. Now it looks like roadkill. With additional illumination from the glowbug, we see the wall to the right and ceiling are spongesmashed with blood and drying bits of gore. The floor has a small pool, and the left wall has absolutely nothing. It looks like someone was hit by a car on the TR side of this passageway. They're wearing what remains of a gilly suit. They have a satchel, partially crushed and torn. Underneath their body is a very large hunting crossbow - full length of their stout body.

Emrite retrieves the satchel and the surprisingly undamaged crossbow towards us. The crossbow is slim profiled with several counterpullies. As it gets closer, we can see several things. The satchel is dripping, but not blood. There is a strong chemical odor coming out from the satchel. Emrite turns it over in the air and catches the items as they come out.

WE FIND:
K - 1) Good Binoculars, with charged battery
Cassius - 2) Entrenching tool, can double as hand weapon with a hammer on the back. Made from titanium, with smears of local mud. Completely utilitarian and unadorned.
K - 3) Very small screen like a razer flip phone or compact. Similarly unadorned. 4) Wide variety of glass vials, all smashed, unlabled, previously full of chemical.
Hugo - 5) Electric lamp, bought off a shelf somewhere.
1/M - 6) 3 A cells
K - 7) 6 unbroken vials, like small test tubes. Built like heavy duty glass with a pressure seal and lock, with stuff floating in them.
(V1) Dirty lakewater, bioscanner alerts that it's extremely thick with necrotizing bacteria
(V2) puplish-blue slurry, bioscanner alerts thick with (probably) hallucinagenic mycotoxin equal with nematocysts like on a jellyfish or man-o-war
(V3) looks like orbitz drink, appears to be alive, and identifies them as parasitic eel eggs.
(V4) Completely clear, looks like water, bioscanner indicates that it is NOT WATER. Appears to be cactus extract, and a neurotoxin.
(V5) Clear, slightly metallic liquid, with metallic fishing line inside, spooled up and hanging in a loose bundle. No biological indication.
(V6) Like nothing we've seen in our lives. It reacts to light like ferrous liquids to magnets.
E - 8) Crossbow, profiled like a sniper rifle. It is a shockingly powerful crossbow. This cannot be bought. An extremely talented craftsman made this. We find 10 50-inch bolts for it, identical to the ones we found embedded in the GN. The materials to withstand the forces the crossbow generated would require technology equivalent to the sheer rifle.

It seems likely we found the motherfucker who hurt our baby. Emrite squeegees the blood and chemicals off to the side and we proceed. Kruti scanns the slurry and it comes up with a CVS receipt worth of alarms about how severely dangerous it is. Not just with the individual effects, but also combinatory effects. However, none of these are what the bioscanner says killed the person. It was loads of blunt force trauma, like having a safe or piano dropped on them. They died roughly 48 hours ago.

At the far end of the hall, at the limit of the light is a reflectivity. Kruti uses the new binoculars to look down the hall. The hallway appears to lead into another broader (30') chamber with a highly reflective construction. The chamber beyond is not regularly shaped.

We enter the next chamber and are in a nautiloid shell. It's polished to a reflective sheen. The polish and translucency makes it look like there are ghosts of ourselves watching us walk around the room. There is another chamber just beyond.

There are stairs that go out into a void with no containment, and we are able to hear the shifting chains of the upper room and see massive stalactites and stalagmites. 70deg down it extends down and finishes in a landing. There is also a particularly ornate bird-like cage split down the middle and removed from the bottom. This is mounted onto a long implement along with a small hand sits at the bottom of the stairs. It's sprawled out in a pool of what looks like dried blood, sticking out of the archway out of the structure.

We hammer in climbing anchors, rope ourselves together, and descend to check out the landing. Inside the archway, we find the body of a young and beautiful woman. She's lying on the ground, dead. She looks like she couldn't have been more than 20. She's clutching the strange scepter. It looks like a medical device, with a mass or technological bulk in the center. It looks like it's supposed to fit against some part of a body. It's clearly covered in some kind of power conduit. There is a lozenge-like module that runs up to the cage and a second lozenge inside the cage. It's meant to be pressed up against some part of the human body, but has enough cruelty to it that it doesn't seem meant for therapeudic use. The cause of death is fairly obvious: her torso is rotated 180 degrees to her legs. She also died roughly 48 hours ago. She's wearing mud-spattered hiking boots and weather-appropriate hiking pants, a durable rain shell, and a high fashion blouse. She has a profusion of rings on all her fingers and, lying nearby, a sizeable leather messenger bag. Emrite empties it.

WE FIND:

1. Profusion of used compads, some that look like cheap off the shelf whatever devices, some like extremely expensive high-end devices, and none look new. They're clearly well-used. None broken.
2. Large number of completely burnt out A cells - 6-7
3. Bundle of {POWERFUL OPIATE} peraphrenalia in clear, flexible plastic.
4. Tightly wrapped bundle of clothing, like a formal dress - haute couture

There's a human-sized arch that goes back into the structure. It goes straight back into the calcite column in the same way that the passage out went in. Down here there is a hallway that ends in a room with a hole in the floor and a large ladder, 2x as large as the last one. After that is a room as large as the trapdoor/wheel room upstairs, but is used primarily for storage with another wheel and cables going out and back into the ground.

Emrite opts to start turning on the compads and check them for data. As she does, we hear bootup noises from companies and models from 7-10 years ago. None of them are still functional like compads, but they still store data and are usable as computing devices. Most of their functionality is deliberately disabled, with the personal information of formal owners on them. None of them require any sort of login or authentication. They all have a bunch of correspondence on them, the personal messages of their owners. They all have academic titles. They were all professors, educators, or researchers. Their info indicates biopsionics specialties in various ways - biopsionics, biotech WRT psionics, psionics WRT biotech, etc. There are reunion letters, like one from a famous researcher thanking Zalushka Vonderlinth for her response, but there isn't much money in personal projection psionic research. The concepts being discussed are basically using metadimensional energy to be in two places simultaneously at once - possibly even corporeally. Whoever wrote the thing they declined, has written a sprawling treatise on the topic filled with both garbage and remarkable thought. Lots has been deleted. Another message is sending an article to an editor that has been approved from an academic research journal, with the first guy's name describing, in tremendous detail, displacement techniques. Zalushka isn't mentioned, and all the crap is cleaned out of it. The only other relevant information is some sort of classified research project - working titled "The Snakewood Device" - it's all encrypted and has not been broken open. It's hardcore military-grade encryption. Emrite saves the files to her slab and figures she'll deal with it later.

The stairs continue down roughly 200ft until they abruptly stop, and continue up roughly 200ft before meeting the ceiling.

We continue into the storage room and find the stack of Pelican-case-like storage containers. Emrite opens one up with her telekinesis. There's no decompression. Inside are small boxes, about the size of large matchboxes or a red brick, unlabled. There are several hundred of them. Emrite pulls one out and opens it up. It's full of what look like bullets, and she recognizes them as caseless ammunition. They glow very faintly with a light blue glow, alertiing us to an unshielded radiological source. It's unlikely to hurt us unless we straight-up ingested it daily for a week or something. Emrite recognizes them as radiological tracking rounds. The mercs whistle appreciatively.

The next crate contains 50 radiological smart weapons systems made to be fit onto combat rifles. We have the mercs outfit their rifles with the new systems.

Another crate contains 50 combat rifles in a fashion we've never seen before. They are unique styles of fully automatic battle rifles. The entire rifle looks like the're meant be held and used in a certain way by a specific shape of person. They just look like they were produced by something that was shaped by a person, but had never met one.

Another crate contains racks of combo brass knuckles and ulu knives. The edges have the same electric blue gleam of a monomolecular edge. It's a case of 100, wrapped for storage. They're made of a single piece of whatever was used to make them, which is black and metallic but not carbon fiber.

Another crate contains similar hand weapons, but have a single extruded haft meant to be carried as hand to hand weapons. These are also made of single pieces of the same material with monomolecular blades. At the bottom of each one is a ring mounted to the bottom of the shaft, about the same width as a can of soda.

Another crate, is much lighter than the others and lined with something unusual - a dull grey metal. This one is chased through with circuitry, and is pretty obviously psi-tech. Kruti examines the lining material with an assayer from the posttech toolkit and finds that it's a lead lining. The circuitry looks similar to the saber. She picks it up and learn that the shaft has a black on black relief carving which is a stamp of the QR code language. This one translates as a single word: auscultation. It matches the heartbeat of whoever the tip of the weapon is pointing at. Saying the word out loud gives an additional beat outside of the others. Thinking the word does the same thing. The bioscanner doesn't reveal anything new, but does reveal that nanoparticals are roughly 10x the expected level. She sets it back in the case and wheels it off to the side.

Another case has another single object inside with a significant amount of structural framework padding, and is a black ball inside a case about the size of an orange with key slots on either side of it. Bioscanner doesn't say anything, posttech assayer has no clue what it is. It's a metal that's not in the database. It's extremely resonant at certain frequencies. It will be magnified at certain frequencies. It's very dense, and there's something moving inside of it.

The eight crate contains 50 breakdown climbing poles with razor-sharp crescent hook and barb on the end with a flipovercap for the crescent hook. The whole thing can breakdown and compress to the size of a flashlight. They are shockingly light.

The ninth crate has lanterns. The design is profoundly strange. They give out redshift light, not messing with night vision. One is clearly marked as separate. It has an active battery, but doesn't have any noticable effect. It throws out low-grade infrared light.

The last crate contains 50 gas masks and tank sets that look like they hook up. The seals on all of them are completely degraded. The straps on the masks don't look like they'd fit around human heads - they're in the wrong place. If you stretched a human head cartoonishly, it might fit. Otherwise, no. They have two eye spots and a mouth, but would look like a Looney Toons character.

Kruti investigates the strange bird cage device to find it emitting nanoparticles into the area. They're a smart fog, networked and active, with an unclear purpose. They're produced at a continuous rate by the object she's scanning.

## 2020--S -- Session 017 #S017

We begin back in the storage room, seeing that there's another shaft down. Additionally, another wheel with cables that descend into the floor. Upon approaching them, we realize they're chains. We use a lantern from the box, which illuminates a globe of the room in blood red light. The wheel and the chains are patina'd and look old - but are not broken. Looking down into the chain shafts descend past the reach of the light in the left shaft, while the right shaft has an object in the shaft 40 ft down. The chain is connected directly to it, while the other chain descends through a channel in the shaft. The object almost fills the entire shaft. We realize that we're looking at the top of an elevator car. Since we approached the wheel, we notice that the far end of the room has an alcove and a tunnel to proceed.

We go down the tunnel and come to an ornate, nearly circular arch. 15m beyond the edge is a veritically hanging chain, stretching up as far as our light can reach. A narrowing of the calcite structure with another calcite structure. We see that we're midway down a massive stalactite looking at another across from us, with a chain attached up where the two nearly come together. We can see something up near where it attaches - roughly 3-4m above where the chain is anchored is a span of metal bridging the two stalactites. It's vertical, and clearly stained. Above it is a bronze trap door with a yawning, toothed mouth. Across from us, there's no place for us to swing to. Below us, we can see a number of steel cables or chains mounted to the sides of the stalactites and stretching down. They're taut, at complimentary angles between the structures, but we can't see all the way down. There's roughly a dozen of them. The closest attachment point is easily 30m below us.

We return to the storage room to find that nothing has changed in our short absence. We decide to take the ladder hole down. The ladder goes down another 30m, hits an antechamber, and goes down further into a broad hall.

Hanging from the ceiling is a cargo cage. The E and S walls hace stairs down, and another ladder descends into the floor. On the east wall is a garage-door sized bronze door with patterns, gears, and symbols. It's currently down, but is designed to collapse upwards like a garage door. It is broad as a 3-lane highway. On the side of it is a chain pulley linked up to the mechanism by the door. It's roughly human height.

We float a compad up to surveil the cargo cage and find that it's empty. As we're trying to clear floors as we go, we decide to open the bronze door. The chains we saw before come down here to connect to bulbous structural connectors of an amber substance that connect to a bridge. The bridge extends across from 2/3 down the stalactite we're in to the very bottom of the adjacent stalactite. At the far end is an open archway, roughly the size of the door we just opened. From this side of the doorway on our end, it doesn't appear to be openable from the outside if it were to shut. We decide to close this back up and take the ladder in the floor to continue exploring the current stalactite.

Part of the way down is a side passage with flickering lime green light. We hop off the ladder to investigate. We find a pool of thick, clear liquid. There are three objects in the pool, below the surface. We realize there's a sword - a scimitar - burning with the lime-green flame; a tongue made of silver-grey metal, gently undulating; and a silvery-grey child, an infant - roughly the size of a medium-sized watermelon - sleeping at the bottom of the pool. It looks like a statue or sculpture, until we see its leg kick as though dreaming. The bioscanner alerts that we're not in immediate danger, but there are multiple sources of very powerful radiation in proximity. Emrite attempts to gently shake the baby with her brain, and it reacts a smidge. Kruti approaches closer, and the bioscanner reacts more vehemently. Nearby are significant amounts of Europium, Thorium, and Neptunium.

Emrite tries to pull the sword. It emerges from the liquid on fire. The liquid drops off like hot maple syrup. The Europium notification comes to the forefront. Pulling it free from the pool increases the intensity of the flames. Within a few seconds, it's bright as a torch and the whole thing is more lime-green flame than metal. There doesn't appear to be psitech. The grip is molded to be held in a specific way. Emrite puts it back in the pool.

The first sign something's amiss is when one of the merc asks "What the fuck is that?" climing down more of the ladder. We emerge in another chamber, roughly carved. It's roughly 20ft EW and 40ft NS. Strung up like a tortured star in the center of the room is a radial symmetrically spiked crystal. It's moving. There are chains hanging from the ceiling with hooks stuck into it, holding it up in the air. It's quivering and bleeding small drops. All 16 of its lower spikes have tubes to take in the blood. The floor is stained like a bruise from the fallen ichor. There is also a small table in the corner, on which is a collapsed curling matrix of clay - a 3-dimensional shape that looks bizarrely complex and strange. The walls of the room are covered with mass spec-like patterns.

The bioscanner recognizes the star as a living organism. It gives an error and says that we're looking at a single-celled organism and it's not designed for use on microfauna. It can't identify the creature. Kruti tries to make telepathic contact and succeeds, along with feeling emotions coming off of it - a deep and pervasive sadness. It doesn't communicate in any type of coherent speech, but rather complex emotions. The sadness coming off of it is at least complex as coming off of another person, but is pure. It's not hiding anything, it's just pure sadness. She asks it if it's trapped, and it returns the desire for freedom, but nothing more complicated than wanting to move past an obstacle. She asks it what it is, and gets an extremely complex response. Normally, answers are emotional or sometimes memories of physical sensations. This thing transmits the experience of time. Judging by that response, it's been around for a length of time that she literally can't comprehend. Its response is a length of time that's impossible to process. It's probably 10s of thousands or millions of years old. It doesn't respond when asking if that's how long its been stuck here, nor when she asks if it would hurt us if freed. She asks if it can move, and it weakly shivers and shakes the chains. When asked if it's hurt, it gets the desire to move. She asks if it would like to be freed, and it just shivers. We decide to come back and free it later.

A merc points out that there is a wall of flesh growing over the exit in the ceiling. It has sclera, no iris, and mostly pupil. It's swiveling in the socket, and pressing in from the shaft. On the other side, it sounds like grinding. We roll initiative and hear more grinding and fingers and an arm make their way in.

Rahim shoots a burst with his laser rifle, but misses. He moves to the top of the stairs as well. Emrite also misses with the shear rifle and takes off a chunk of wall. The gnarled cartiloginious hand reaches for Kruti, pushing a hairless and pignosed head push through into the room, grabbing her like a child's toy. Kruti tries to fire at the hand, but the hand flexes and she can't bring her weapon to bear. The mercenaries turn, take a knee, and shoot tracer rounds into the arm - the single-celled organism is an unfortunate bystander between them and the arm. They fire heavily, and the mass is peppered with smart rounds that eventually curve around the other organism. The thing opens its mouth - more like unfurling a soft mouth than a jawbone, filled with tooth-like protrusions, which were grinding like we heard above.

Rahim shoots with another burst of laser fire, and it doesn't quite burn like normal. Emrite also hits with her sheer rifle, but it also deals less damage than expected. The giant sweeps its hand over to grab Cassius and starts whipping him around. He's screaming. Kruti tries to shoot it, but misses. The mercs hear Cassius screaming and look like they're going to try to fire at the hand, but pause instead of maybe hitting Cassius. They instead pull out knives and go hard on the hand. It's not even reacting.

Rahim shoots another burst for damage. Emrite removes chains from the organism and attempts to use one of the chains to injure the giant. It twists in place, avoiding some of the damage. It still has Cassius in its hand. It looks towards Emrite - strange, since she made no noise or gave any indication that she was controlling the chains. It mad-dogs her, and then pops the screaming Cassius right into his mouth. We can still hear him screaming. The remaining mercs scream in abject horror. It reaches up to slap at us, but instead snatches up Emmet. Hugo becomes angry, swearing heavily and unloading another burst of gunfire - mostly getting the walls with tracer rounds. Smart rounds get confused, tracing incorrect impact spots. The organism falls from its chains towards us, even as parts scratch off. It's shedding clear fluid and turning milky-white. It's massive and sharp, though. We take some damage, Kruti more than others - except the impact is sumped by Emrite's telekinesis. Kruti scans us to determine the fluid content and asks the organism if it's ok. The organism is now completely opaque and doesn't respond to the inquiry. The fluid is eventually identified as a biohazard. It shouldn't be consumed, but doesn't warn against using it on your skin. It's a massive, complicated molecule. It's likely a biological origin data storage medium. Hugo fires more (?) and has better luck - dealing considerably more damage.

Rahim fires and misses. Emrite inflicts force on the chains, figuring out how to evade some of the damage. The giant opens its mouth and curls it in as Cassius stops screaming and blood jolts out of the mouth. Cassius is probably dead. Something complicated and bad happens to Emrite: he looks over to Emrite and hits her with Emmet like a meat flail. There's a loud crunch as his armor clatters against hers. Emmet is badly wounded by the impact. Kruti roots around for the vial of deadly neurotoxin and remotely heals Emmet, the meatbat. Hugo still shoots.

Rahim fires more, missing more. Emrite takes the vial of neurotoxin and attempts to put it in the giant's eye, seemingly successfully. Nothing obvious or immediately happens. The giant throws Emmet at Kruti. Kruti tries to wield Ascultation to no avail, and manages to heal Emmet. Hugo seems lost in battle. The arm is pockmarked with craters from the caseless rounds.

## 2020-09-19-S -- Session 018 #S018

Rahim hits with some laser rifle burst fire and starts down the stairs. Emrite fires with her sheer rifle and follows. After throwing Emmett, the giant turns its attention back to Hugo. It backhands Hugo into the wall, who crunches, screams, and clutches his upper right leg. It's pretty obviously broken. Kruti tries to heal Hugo and follow the group. Hugo collects himself, picks up his rifle, and full-on sprints across the room. He makes it to the doorway before Rahim sees him get grabbed and pulled back.

Rahim dashes back up and shoots at the hand. Emrite also shoots at the hand. The giant then throws Hugo at us, hitting Rahim. Kruti continues the retreat. Emmet and Hugo move down the stairs, Hugo trailing some blood. We proceed with the retreat (strategic advance?). At the bottom of the stairs is a new room.

The room is roughly 40' across and 30' wide. The walls are smooth calcite, but the wall on the right is unadorned and looks carved out but not smoothed over. It looks deliberately left rough. There is a series of shelves on it, containing very strange objects. There are room for more, but are only three as of now. At first, they look like bowling-ball sized sculptures. They look like abstract 3D sculptures of mathematical forms. They're symmetrical balls of metal, large enough to hold in both hands. The wall has a geometric display framing. They all are traced through with psi-tech like transistors and such. Two are difficult to look at... It feels like you're looking at them, but there's a disconcerting element to trying to actually focus and lay eyes on them. They're like a 14/10 of something I missed. The third one, if looked at too long, feels like you're moving to the left at 3mph. Looked at out of the corner of your eye, it seems like it's moving.

On the left side of the room, a gigantic semimetallic hemisphere that looks like onion rings. There is a faint nimbus of movement around the other edges. Rahim realizes it looks like a geologic cutaway of a planet, but it's super weird. It looks like the central core is iron and looks covered in... urban structures. A layer outside of that has a lava-lamp substance inside of it that looks like liquid magma - but the inner shell of that sphere are more implications of city-like structures. Another layer of mantle has scattered structures there, and a solid black barrier around that with no detail on it whatsoever. Beyond that is what looks like continental crust spotted with spheres with cities in them, looking like continent-sized places beneath the surface. One has a floating hunk of rock in it, bone-white, that would be a small moon at scale. Some look like they're full of water and could be small oceans. There's fractal structures near the top - cave networks? And near the edge, gently shifting blue. Looking at the edge, he sees that it's actually moving. Minute shreds of condensation is actually moving along the edge. Around the upper reaches at the top, like gears or clocks, are circular dials. They're labelled in a script we haven't seen before. Some glyphs in the script look like the ideograms, but only in general shapes and angles - not character for character. One exit goes south with a hallway to hit another staircase.

Emrite telekinetically breaks off several thousand pounds of stone to collapse the hallway. When she starts, the grinding above stop. She fills the chamber, and they resume. After a few moments, we realize that the noise is actually getting quieter. Fucking awesome :D

Kruti heals Rahim and Hugo, and we level up. Rahim becomes even more like a Palestinian Han Solo with more Shoot and Sneak skills along with

Rahim goes to inspect the globe and sees that it's simulating weather, potentially realtime simulation. It seems to be this planet. Rahim tries to move the outer layer to no avail. Emrite tries a line shunt on a dial and takes roughly 10m to hone in on some EM output. She manages to figure out how to get the translation program to pull useful data from the object. It spits out a timetable, horalogical data. Exact translations are a little fuzzy, but the clocks are apparently timers listed in descending order of interval length with exponential decrease in time. The readout displays in seconds, but it's tough to comprehend. The top is 100s-10s of millions of years. The fastest are reading intervals in decades. This device is measuring down to the nanosecond continental drift, evaporative rate of oceans, cycles of atmospheric change, river progress, glacier melt and reformation, and some kind of interval for several thousand species. Nothing new appears to have started when we arrived. It's definitely a fascinating curiosity, but we don't have much of a reason to believe it's substantial pretech.

Emrite grabs one of the psiballs with her telekinesis and easily moves it. As she drags it over, it behaves very strangely. It's not going in the prescribed direction: it goes opposite. It doesn't seem to have moving parts. It appears to be symmetrical no matter what way it turns. Emrite reaches out and taps it with a finger and sees a clear pattern to how it's constructed. She begins to understand what's happening with it. With additional manipulation, she might be able to figure out the pattern. There is information to be retrieved from this thing with time. She grabs it fully.

It feels like it's filled with extremely dense liquid, providing secondary force as it's moved. As it's rotated, it feels like her hands are being rotated in directions they shouldn't be pulled in. There's no central structure, but it's as though the center of gravity is moving as rotated, and isn't inside the object being held. Those of us looking on see strange portions of the room and perspectives through the negative space on the object.

We hook up through the group telepathic link - straining Kruti in a way that few things have - and we collectively grasp what the object might do and how to make it do it. It's a combination complex problem and proof of higher dimensional mathematics. Because it's a proof, can be used to demonstrate those energies and angles. It can once allow a user to select the direction of local gravity in a 50ft radius. Demonstrating it will consume the object. There's room for 30-40 of these things, and there are only 3 left (inclusive of the one we now possess).

Emrite pulls in the other one that looks most like this one. We use the same psychic concert to examine the second one. After about 2 minutes we figure out that it's a similar proof that affects personal gravity direction. It can be invoked once, ever, and cannot be changed while happening. The duration of the effect is determined by the character's INT: INT score rounds, stopped at any point, not restarted.

We try the last one. Human cognition has a limit to the strains it can endure without breaking. The experience we survive adds several standard deviations to the high point of what was previously thought possible to that limit. D: Each one of us is subject to temperospacial revelations inside of the space of a few minutes that redefine our relationships with distance, time, matter, and the nature of existence. We reconsider the definition of what it means to be God. While it only contains the ability to do this thing once, it can do the following:

    - Apparent smallness. May "shrink" to any size below their own.
    - Apparent hugeness. May "grow" to any size above their own.
    - Outside time, but not consequence. Can stop, speed up, or rewind time. Cannot change past events, but can view them. Can place self in future at any point and interact from that point on but moves through space no faster than usual.
    - No-clip mode. Can move 360 degrees through floors, walls, and roofs at normal speed.
    - User may select local gravity direction in a 50ft radius.
    - User may select own personal gravity direction.
    - Can change gravity strength. As high or low as preferred. Affects a 50ft radius.
    - User can alter own inertia however they wish. (Light as a feather and fast as The Flash, or heavy as a statue and slow as a slug.)
    - Waveform. User can move at light speed to any visible point.

Rahim takes the local gravity bomb. Emrite takes the god bomb. Kruti hands the field radio to Emmett and takes the personal gravity bomb.

Kruti asks that we unblock the corridor and retreive the boxes left upstairs. Emrite does so, uses telekinesis to move up and grab the boxes, and comes back down. We proceed down the hallway and up the stairs to find a room with filing cabinets in it. Rows of them. The only exit is a broad ladder leading up. All the cabinets have been opened, drawers extended, and all material has been piled in the center of the room and burnt. The burn didn't finish, and lots of papers are have been pushed around the room. There are a good number of mostly intact pieces around the room.

The first paper (or pressed sheef of pulpy matter) has lines of glyphs seen on the clock, embossed into the surface of the material. The structure has held up well despite age. The header is translated (chugging a bit) a stygiograph and the title is "Secret Caches in the Spire of Death From Whence He Observes." Kruti's translator program takes in the rest of the document, but gets a warning that it's highly self-referential and will take some time to properly interpret. There are two other nearly-intact documents. The second is a similar format, titled "The Tribes of the Ziggurats of Iron." Rahim begins to feed it through his compad. Emrite gets some kind of report on "Freshwater Sources in the Drowned City Beneath God-Vomit Falls."

## 2020-09-26-S -- Session 019 #S019

We continue further down into a domed room, about the size of a 2-car garage with one entrance and no door. The center of the room is dominated by a huge steel wheel with complex intermeshed gears with lesser wheels arranged around it. They can be turned separately. They're like steering wheels, mounted parallel to the ground. The wheel is 15' across, while the lesser wheels are as broad across as a truck tire. They're arranged around the central wheel. They don't turn on their own. Roughly 10-12 wheels aside from the central.

Kruuti attempts to see the future, and has a vision of hanging upside down in a pit and being overwhelmed with light and then suddenly standing on a busy street corner on an alient planet.

Emrite goes to move the wheel with her telekinesis, and it moves fairly easily. It's counterweighted. Below our feet, we hear a deep and hollow THOOM! Like a massive metal object striking another - like a mechanism shifting, not like something dropping. The wheel them stops turning. She turns the rest of the wheels, but not further noises or obvious effects take place. Nothing else happens in the room.

We continue further down and emerge through a caged spiral staircase below the entire mass of the stalactite. There is virtually nothing around us to be seen, except two enormous sections of dome that open below us - making us the pearl in a clam. Gears operate them, leading into the wheel room. The metal making up the half-shells is the same off-color bronze on the trap door with the mouth on it. Below us is some kind of pod like a closed walnut that the stairs go into. About the size of a large SUV or escape pod. In the chamber is a single seat, not attached to the floor. It's attached to a geared mechanism that rotates the seat to face down. It's attached to the ceiling. It's set up to rotate downwards, and an enormous lever next to it. The chair has straps to hold one in, and is set up to rotate downwards. From within, we can see that there are large gears on all four sides of the walls, near where the walls touch the flat floor. There is a cross-section seam running the length and breadth of the chamber.

Rahim volunteers to be the guinea pig in the chair. He gets harnessed into the chair with an additional safety line leading out to Emrite and anchored to a cage. Rahim tries to translate the two cards, and gets back:

Objects Are Further Away Than They Appear
Please Do Not View The Leviathan Mines

Rahim operates the lever and the floor beneath drops away, and the seat tips straight down. With a shudder of dust shaking down from the central column, the pillar extends down slowly as it extends slowly down. It goes down 15 feet before it stops moving. In time with the clanking, the chair starts craning around, calibrating? Upside down at first and the until he's half upside-down, and then goes left to right. Below him is immesurable distance, consuming blackness. Nothing below except the rim of an enormous lense. Not clear what's supporting it. The edge has a faint gleam from the lights, and it more or less fills his vision. Looking through it, there's a growing light from something beyond the lens. As he continues to stare at it, the lights fade to darkness. The space beyond begins brightening. There are rivers of writhing blackness moving below. Black on black shifting darkness begins somehow growing in luminescense. He feels himself lurch as his perception shifts until he finds himself looking at a new scene. Though gravity acts on him as it previous did, his view is completely different. He's standing on the deck of a ship upright. He's still in the seat, but it seems that he's on the deck of a ship. He can see out into the expanse of space and to a planet below. Around him are the hexagonal shapes of insect hives, like a paper wasp nest. Traced through them are firmer, but organic, shapes of metal. Interface pads? Clustering near each pad is a 7.5' glass wasp filled with a churning opaque gas. The air around is swirling with changing smells and forces. Their wings are occassionally buzzing with the sound of glass armonicas all around. The planet is maybe earth-sized, terrestrial, bathed in the light of a sun. It appears to be completely covered in megastructures of fungal blooms that stretch across the intervening distance of continents, choking out oceans, and literally writhing jets of sports as large as attack ships and fighter jets. A crescendo of communication on the bridge precedes a barrage of missiles streaking down to the planet and blooming into nuclear mushrooms. The entire quarter of the planet that's visible is shrouded in a roaring wave of fire and smoke. The only thing coming to mind is that a planet overcome by fungal spores sounds like the omachi system guarded by enormous skyscrapers floating in space pre-Terran Mandate. He can focus and change his vision. He can't leave the room, but can view things in the room with more detail as though physically there. Trying to leave the room blacks out the vision.

Rahim goes in on a readout screen, but it's not in a language he knows. He recognizes the Atra, the sole alien species. They're in Kasama. They're an argon vespaform species, presiding over non-Atra alien ruins in a tribal structure that's still technically advanced. They don't have a navy. Those who go to Omachi are unceremoniously destroyed by giant space robots. He can't seem to interact with anything.

Attempting to move the wheels while the dome is open reveals that they won't move.

As the light fades, he can see that there's a lesser lense that's closer than the giant lense and a number of shoot-like mechanisms surrounding it it. Like a pinhole camera. There were racks and racks of space.

The compad recording got the entire video of the experience from my initial perspective.

Kruuti turns a wheel, I pull the lever, and we go down again. As he goes down again, Rahim has a better sense of the mechanism. Light turns to dark, the stone below turns to light, and he finds himself in the midst of a battle. Again standing in a biological structure - now like a fleshy heart chamber inside an enormous creature's organ. It's cobalt blue around him, shot through with a fatty marble white. Walking along the surface are mobile warframes of the Hutton Sodality. They're heavily armored, blazing away with energy weapons against a tide - so many as to be liquid - of cobalt blue disassembled humanoid forms. Half a torso with the arm shooting out with a bladelike spear jutting out made of bones; bottom halves with eyes in the crotch; crazy shit. they're shooting out of a sphincter. The tide crashes down, the impact cracking their chassis and boiling black/red cloud of fog jets out of them. The cloud turns the blue flesh into a dead, coral, crumbling clay. Like a dried out sand castle kicked over. A constant churn wages back and forth. They're practically being birthed as fast as they die.

Kruuti wants to try and rotate back to that first position, and we go through the steps. Descending again, the view is now of a cleaner place. It's a laboratory - modern, well-kept, -equipped, and -appointed. There is high-energy experimentation materials around. It's a big space with door seals, and all the doors are airlocked. The wild part is that the room is full of robotic chimps in lab coats manipulating the materials. A central isolation chamber clad in steel and reinforcement banding with giant conduits of gaseous mediums and humming loudly with energy. In the center is a single black ball about the size of a tennis ball. The entirety of the mechanism is limbed with frost and frost crystals. The readouts in the lab are in Mandate Common. It's 20 sig digs .000...0001 above absolute zero. Projecting perception into the chamber, he finds... the thing.

They have a conversation, he gets the puzzle.

He seizes, they pull him out, and he tells them briefly about the encounter. The floor below where he seized was turned to gold. :O

The cards have readouts similar to the ones we've seen elsewhere in the building. The translations read:

    [ Inhumanly chivalrous insect knights / smashing gods, changing the faith by fire of / "Forclose", the Knotsmen's tangled capital ]

    [ Murderous surveyors, hoarded with string / earning by murder the fearful respect of / The Death-Dream Fortress of the Ever-Dying King ]

    [ Philosophical monsters making maps / driven to madness with fear and hate of / crystal-zero guards of the Moon-Giant's Maze ]

This is in pentameter.

We turn the wheel again the clamshell has closed again. We go up the stairs to the file cabinet room and head up the ladder in that. There's another ladder going up and see a slot with the second cage-like aperture. We're on the same level we were on with the giant. We head further up and find ourselves in a hallway chamber. 40ft to the left and right are spiral stairs leading up, not in mesh cages. We go to the north staircase and hear a new noise: a soft rustling, like bird wings or moth wings. A continuous brushing noise, coming from the interior of the spiral staircase. We see that the spiral staircase is wrapped in a fine metal cage and, though we're 100% certain we're in the stalactite and it's not outside, we don't see any reflection from outside the cage. There are no reflections, not even distant glittering. No pressure in air pressure or currents. The other staircase is identical.

We head up with Hugo up front and Emmet in back. He gets to the threshold, clutches his head, shakes it, turns, and violently vomits. We pull him out, and he's healthy to the scanner. Kruuti looks inside the stairwell and, past the cage, reality is throbbing and the air is warped in the blackness outside the cage. Turning her head down, she's able to focus and stabilize. She smells corn chips and the soft sound of feathery wings. The light plays, and she sees the obvious shadow of a moth scuttling along the stairs in front of her. Looking out beyond the cage is fucky, but we can advance by not looking out there. On the interior of the mesh is a grate - a moth trap - with sticky residue. She bioscans herself and finds she's healthy.

The cage surrounding the cage and the trap are the only noticably rusty things we've found in the facility. We head up the stairs, passing more tray traps. The sound of the moths doesn't go away, and their shadows impossibly pass along the stairs. As we near the top of the stairs, we realize we're smelling the smells of honey and blood from the residue in the trays.

As we come up the stairs, we come across the giant again. Rahim goes first and tries to say one of his words, but it comes out as the full line of jumbled letters in the puzzle: RYLIEKTCA! Immediately, we all understand it as a name. The world changes. What was before is different to what is now. The rubber-boned horror suddenly faceplants into the ground and we hear his teeth scraping across the floor as he goes limp and falls to the ground and he has a mimicry of Rahim's previous seizure. He goes for the ladder back up and realizes that he aches, and there's no doubt in his mind that doing that has a cost. Emrite uses her whole turn to head up the ladder, and is halfway up. The mercs bolt as well, more or less on pace with Emrite. Kruuti uses Teratic Overload on it, damaging it a bit. It continues to thrash around, and we realize it's got to be like 70ft long. It's a massive, hairless mannequin creature. The thought occurs to us that we're happy we didn't sleep down here.

Rahim continues his way up the ladder. Emrite climbs as well. The mercenaries haul ass as well. Kruuti climbs as well. The giant thrashes.

Rahim finishes the climb and prepares to shoot the giant. Emrite prepares rope to strangle the giant. The mercs prepare to shoot the giant. Kruuti finishes the climb and prepares her spike thrower to fire on the giant.

Rahim still hangs in to shoot the giant. Emrite rappels down the ladder with some rope and attempts to strangle the giant with an additional length of rope. She succeeds, but maybe to less effect? Its neck deforms under the crushing force being applied. Mercs hold position. Kruuti waits as well. The giant thrashes, chokes, and hacks reflexively. It hasn't harmed the calcite. The thrashing subsides and it's starting to regain its senses, as it tries to grab ineffectually at the rope.

Rahim stays at the top, prepared to fire. Emrite continues choking the giant. The rope digs into the giant's neck, and she sees milky white blood leaking from the neck. The dynamic rope has reached the limit of its ability to stretch, and it's creaking under the telekinesis. Kruuti cheers her on. The giant is no longer seizing, and turns to look directly at Emrite. It tries to worm its fingers underneath the thing choking it, and begins dragging itself across the floor towards her.

Rahim stays prepared to fire. Emrite squeezes as much as she can, trying to kill it. Rahim tells the mercs to prepare to haul in Emrite. Kruuti holds as well. The giant comes into the shaft. Rahim misses, Kruuti hits, and the mercs haul her up. The stretch in the rope keeps her in place a bit longer than she'd like, but the giant still misses its attack on her.

Rahim fires off more laser fire. Emrite continues choking it, as it now begins bleeding freely where the rope has dug into the meat of its body. The mercs blaze away, but miss and hit the bottom of the shaft. Kruuti misses. The giant attempts to haul itself up the shaft and grabs Hugo's legs and breaks them super bad.

Rahim lays into the hand with laser fire, finally carving through existing issues with the flesh. Emrite throws Hugo a line, trying to help him escape. Hugo hauls on the line, pulling himself free. Emmet unloads into the giant's palm, blazing away as forcefully as any of us. Kruuti throws plenty of spikes at it as well. The giant tries to pull his hand back, pulling with enough force to crack the floor. Then he reverses course, throwing 10' of his arm into the room and thrashing. The three of us dodge it as it flails around, until it catches Emmet and hits the wall hard. The giant's flailing hits him 2-4 times.

Rahim fires into the hand further. Emrite can't squeeze anymore due to the arm in the way, so she levels the sheer rifle at the hand. There are grievous flesh wounds as it flails around. Emmet continues to rest on death's doorstep. Hugo grabs his rifle and blasts away. Hugo blows several large holes in the arm. While Kruuti revives Emmet with a Lazarus Patch. The giant continues to thrash. It flops down hard, splashing us with gross fluids, knocking some of us to the floor. The giant appears to be able to barely be able to move

Rahim deals literally minimal damage, but killing the giant!
