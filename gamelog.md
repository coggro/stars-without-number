## 2020-05-16-S -- Session 001

Our story begins with us unable to move and panicked. Stark chemical smell in the air. Crash couch enveloping our bodies. Klaxons screaming bleeding through the claustrophobic grip of the crash couch, and the ship shudders violently towards the surface of the planet we've never been to before. But it didn't start out like this...

We were individually approached by a Derendali merchant - **Herandor Vonketosen**. Made contact in his private quarters. We eyeball each other over a low table. Each of us had responded to a subtle advertisement for work befitting our talents. Table is laid out with small dishes and drinks. We've been waiting for 45 minutes or so for him to come out of his private quarters and meet us.

**Emrite** - all black jumpsuit. Hair braided and back. Ambiguous and forgettable. Laser pistol at her side.

\*\*Weird not to be carrying some form of personal protection. Need to be able to defend yourself until security forces show. Standard issue rifle is normal, larger weapons are conspicuous. If you're in armor, you're expecting that's necessary.

**Rahim** - Palestinian Han Solo

**Kruti** - Ellaria Sand. Loose-fitting britches, knee-high boots over flowing top. Pistol at side. Backpack.

Harandor hasn't been in the shipping industry for very long - Vanketosen shipping is about 8 weeks old. In good standing with authorities. Caste system is strictly divided - Military/Psychic, Compulsory service (most people remain here), Discharged/Unable To Serve (Merchants), and Vonketosen is definitely in the merchant class. Makes sense for him to be reaching out to us outside the law, since this is his best opportunity.

Framed Derendali flight suit of significant rank with his name embroidered on the side ofit on the wall, in a place of honor & highlighted, when we came in. Framed case next to it of Derendali medals of service. He's a decorated captain. Weird that it didn't show up when we looked him up.

Food is running low, have cooled, and drinks are nearly gone. He still hasn't come out.

When we showed up, an electronic call & response let us in. Unintelligent service drone served us food & drink. It's an expensive residential area. It's a receiving area with incense burning. Incense is like art hanging on the wall, and this incense is good and expensive - lit fresh when we showed up.

We're looking through a well-stocked kitchen, when we hear a thump come from upstairs - a single heavy object being dropped on carpet. Emrite suggests checking it out, and we head upstairs. We smell the strong scent of alcohol. We find a figure hanging torso off the bed with a mostly-empty bottle of liquor on the ground. He is wearing a silk robe and silk pants underneath and seems to be dead/passed out/unclear?

Emrite checks for a pulse. He is surrounded in a cloud of alcoholic haze. The bottle is 90% empty, and she thinks she knows where that 90% is... He's breathing, but shallowly. This is definitly Vonketosen. As Emrite and Kruti move him onto the bed, he makes mewling noises and attempts speech, but is massively inebriated.

We see a small bottle of fruit nectar that might've made a good mixer, but not for all of the alcohol that he's consumed. On the other side of the bed, scattered around the floor are bank statement printouts - with considerable red ink. Near the statements is a military officer's sidearm - a charged laser pistol, safety on.

There's lots scattered around. It's densely packed with things accumulated over life. It becomes obvious that he was a pilot. Images displayed in frames, art on the wall, photos of others in flight gear, etc. It will probably take a few hours for him to come out of this, unless we do something else to speed it up. Emrite and Rahim begin to look around the estate for a medkit.

Kruti checks his pockets and finds his compad, which he's left unlocked. There is a half-composed email/letter. It starts out incoherent _and gets worse_.

`youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuudddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd ............. ;a`

The recipient is already keyed in: **Shenkor Mohejen**. Kruti has never heard this name before. She pokes into the rest of the emails. There are so many past due notices in his inbox that it looks like a spam folder. It appears that he's a broke person attempting to stay in high society. Limo services, air taxes, expensive food delivery, etc.

Kruti looks at the financial documents and figures out that most of his wealth was in investments - hugely diversified - but within the same week, his banks told him that "Due to a discrepency in your accounts and issues with the origins of your investments, we have zeroed out your accounts."

Rahim and Emrite find a medkit, but almost all the drugs have already been taken. There is one dose remaining of a mild stimulant in a single-use spray - like two more pills at the bottom of a container of caffeine pills. In looking in his wardrobe, we find a military full dress uniform.

Rahim stims Vonketosen, who promptly vomits all over him, begins to try to throttle him, and curses Shenkor. Rahim manages to push him back onto the bed, where is sobbing like a child. Emrite asks him if he's ok, and if he would like a shower. His service drone offers laundry service, which Rahim takes adavantage of. We hear crying from the shower, and shortly thereafer, Vonketosen emerges dressed and cleaned. Rahim gets a suit.

He's destitute. He can't afford the house, his cars have been repossessed, and he expects to be evicted. We are his literal last hope. He'll be on the street shortly. He's a desparate man. Emrite asks what he needs. Crudely put, he needs more money than God. He believes that he knows where to find it, in return for a slice of it.

He asked if we have heard of Shenkor, a Coven Intelligence Agent, and his rival for a promotion in the agency. He learned of his situation before Vonketosen did - a fortune built on lies. Thought to be shipping magnates, built upon a ponzi scheme. He inherited his wealth. Was "a motherfucker of a pilot," but inherited his money.

He was up for a position training pilots for intel/observation craft. Mohejen figured out the false fortune, and saw fit to alert all institutions simultaneously. We are to be the instruments on his revenge. In exchange for being the viscious hand of retribution against this cumstain of a man, we will be made rich beyond our wildest dreams. He's landlocked - but we are not. He knows about several opportunities he meant to pursue after his service to the coven.

He knows of a cache of pre-tech on Hartoum, one jump away. The locals are... questionably aware of it. He believes that we can get there, recover it, and bring it back to him. Or, at least, firm evidence of its existence. He can leverage his reputation to retreive the rest and make us fabulously wealthy. Why not take it for ourselves? Vonketosen believes that when he bonded with his familiar, more of the animal made it into him. He's an accomplished telepath, and suggests that we not end up in the same room.

When we leave, he will be consuming the remainder of his alcohol and getting so drunk that he will forget the majority of the conversation. When we accomplish what he's sent us to do, we will give him a passphrase, and give him a treasure to double his initial fortunes. We cannot bring it off Hartoum, but he could make that happen.

The pre-tech can see things that travel over the speed of light. If we can locate and secure the observatory, he should be able to outmaneuver Shenkor and make us rich. The best he can tell us is that it's somewhere near Karomir, a simple village. Stories of the observatory are traced back to this village. We're probably not the only ones looking. He has some hard currency remaining to get us transport. We can't get our own ship, but should be able to get passage on a trading ship. We would have standard passenger fare.

He believes he would be able to offer us 1MM credits of astronautical work at the shipyards - enough for a reasonably valuable ship. We agree, and he heads out to his kitchen. We put together an order for some extra stuff, and it should be delivered to the **Benorgu Beauty** - a medkit, a Hartoum survival kit, a shear rifle, 5 line shunts, trade metals, and a bioscanner.

We get pings about 10m after we step outside with flight itineraries to board the ship in 16 hours. It's a trading ship with passenger service, and is bound for Hartoum and Points Further. It drills into the system, ferries people with the shipboard shuttle, and drills out.

We leave, and go to a bar to get to know each other a little better.

## -- RESEARCH --

Emrite pulls out her dataslab and looks for information on Shenkor Mohejen. She finds a reference to an awards ceremony when he entered the intelligence service and earned a high medal for achievement. In the photo, he looks extraordinarily nondescript. Military haircut, no tattoos or scars. He's a man of slight build.

Herendor isn't mentioned much. His entry to pilot candidacy school, but they don't publish much regarding their military exploits. His most recent hit is a public news article of how he was dismissed from military service dishonorably two months ago. Within two weeks, he was dishonorably discharged and all of his investments vanished. His parents died about a year ago. His father was a business magnate, and his death was notable.

We learn a few things about one another:

```
Emrite spent 15 years of her life traveling with her bounty hunter godmother, a talented psychic who taught her what she could.

While employed with the Merchant Marines, Rahim mapped a faster route between Jerash and Vindelicorum.

Kruti is a procurer and augmentor of goods. She's not a drug dealer, but she can get you what you want.
```

We decide not to dig further into Shenkor, and head for the Beauty.

## -- The Beauty --

The Beauty is a sizable frigate with a considerable weapon mounted. We head through the crowds to the ship. We board, find our seats (in a block next to each other). The docking clamps release, and we take off. We head towards the edge of the system and begin the spike drill to Hartoum.

Our ticket includes a coffin-hotel sleeping space and meager food. There's a common eating space that we eat at in shifts. Common knowledge is that people are going to Hartoum for a pilgrimage. People spend some time on Hartoum, which is deliberately very simple - TL 2, Industrial Revolution - so that they can live a simple life for religious contemplation.

There was never a jump gate here. The colony ship in orbit was a small, floating city. Portions of it are still powered, and people live on it. Some of it functions as an abbey or monestary, serving a religion that sprang up around the settling of this sector. Chunks of the ship have fallen from orbit and survived.

A ship with standard scanning ablities and a telemetry will be able to look at a planet and get relatively simple data back - atmosphere, geology, advanced energy-using surface communities, ships in orbit, and features designed to attract orbital interest. We'd need dedicated scanning tech to find things from orbit.

We come to and are able to emerge from the crash couch into the blinding light on the surface of Hartoum. Something broke - a tremendous bang - on the shuttle, and we spiraled down fast enough to pin us to the floor. At the last moment, emergency safety protocols engaged, and the cabin filled with impact-absorbing foam. Also contains a potent sedative.

We're standing in a large crater. The shuttle, that held 50 people, and is scattered around the crater. The largest chunk at the bottom is burning heavily. The cargo portion cracked, and there is a line of baggage around 800 ft long. The sun is overhead and beautiful, the air is fresh and breathable, and a deer looks down on us from the top of the crater. We realize that we're ravenous - like we haven't eaten in days - maybe haven't drank in that long, either.

It looks like there's considerable blood along the other crash couches. Crash foam is meant to be tenuous life support system, but also built to decay before they run out of oxygen. It takes 4 days to degrade to the point where the foam will break and we can move naturally.

There's a lot of cratered, shattered foam around with blood on the outside. It went into several big portions and other tiny portions. 3 main chunks fragmented the way it was supposed to. It looks like someone went through the baloons of safety foam, cut or burned them open, and executed the people inside the pods. There are clear marks of laser fire on the bodies inside.

The other poeple in our bloom of foam were killed. A chunk of the shuttle fell on our forner of the pod, and we just happened to be under a chunk of ship. It seems as though we were assumed dead or crushed, and we escaped whatever befell those who traveled with us.

We're in an environment like the scottish highlands. We're all but certain that we're the only survivors. 75 helpless people were killed by whoever raided this crash site. We head towards the cargo field.

A lot survived. The full furrow of the ship is 2,000 ft long or so. Most of the cargo is clothes, effects, etc. Some hard case cargo containers have survived.

Over an hour and a half, we're able to put together a pile of things that weren't shredded by the crash, including our cargo container. Emrite opens up the crate. The internal framing is destroyed.

The medkit, shear rifle, and trade metals survived.

The survival kit, line shunts, and bioscanner were destroyed.

We're able to crack into the first class portions of food on the shuttle. We have 10 person/days of food and water.

As we check out the shattered remnatns of the shuttle, we come across the portion of the shuttle that contained the escape pods. There are 6 pods. 5 are still attached and crushed beyond repair - 1 is missing.

## 2020-05-23-S -- Session 002

We are in the smoking crater of the ship's boat. Something terrible happened on our way down, and so we have awakened several days after the crash. It's roughly 4AM.

"The crash has really thrown a wrench in your plans."

We stand on the lip of the crater. Emrite uses the light on her metatool to look at the area around us and notices that the ground around us is incredibly muddy. That's odd, since we're at the top of a hill... The trees around us look odd as well. Those near us have mud splashed on them up around mid-thigh height. There is something splashing in a nearby mud puddle.

Kruuti takes out her light as well and we see a mostly-translucent speckled 6-tentacled cephalopod. Nearby, another also splashes in the puddle. It's a muggy bog. We're a good 75 ft above the plains below us.

We see lots of broken trees, but they aren't pointed towards the crater. Kruuti attempts to fix the bioscanne.
