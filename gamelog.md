## 2020-05-16-S -- Session 001

Our story begins with us unable to move and panicked. Stark chemical smell in the air. Crash couch enveloping our bodies. Klaxons screaming bleeding through the claustrophobic grip of the crash couch, and the ship shudders violently towards the surface of the planet we've never been to before. But it didn't start out like this...

We were individually approached by a Derendali merchant - **Herandor Vonketosen**. Made contact in his private quarters. We eyeball each other over a low table. Each of us had responded to a subtle advertisement for work befitting our talents. Table is laid out with small dishes and drinks. We've been waiting for 45 minutes or so for him to come out of his private quarters and meet us.

**Emrite** - all black jumpsuit. Hair braided and back. Ambiguous and forgettable. Laser pistol at her side.

\*\*Weird not to be carrying some form of personal protection. Need to be able to defend yourself until security forces show. Standard issue rifle is normal, larger weapons are conspicuous. If you're in armor, you're expecting that's necessary.

**Rahim** - Palestinian Han Solo

**Kruuti** - Ellaria Sand. Loose-fitting britches, knee-high boots over flowing top. Pistol at side. Backpack.

Harandor hasn't been in the shipping industry for very long - Vanketosen shipping is about 8 months old. In good standing with authorities. Caste system is strictly divided - Military/Psychic, Compulsory service (most people remain here), Discharged/Unable To Serve (Merchants), and Vonketosen is definitely in the merchant class. Makes sense for him to be reaching out to us outside the law, since this is his best opportunity.

Framed Derendali flight suit of significant rank with his name embroidered on the side ofit on the wall, in a place of honor & highlighted, when we came in. Framed case next to it of Derendali medals of service. He's a decorated captain. Weird that it didn't show up when we looked him up.

Food is running low, have cooled, and drinks are nearly gone. He still hasn't come out.

When we showed up, an electronic call & response let us in. Unintelligent service drone served us food & drink. It's an expensive residential area. It's a receiving area with incense burning. Incense is like art hanging on the wall, and this incense is good and expensive - lit fresh when we showed up.

We're looking through a well-stocked kitchen, when we hear a thump come from upstairs - a single heavy object being dropped on carpet. Emrite suggests checking it out, and we head upstairs. We smell the strong scent of alcohol. We find a figure hanging torso off the bed with a mostly-empty bottle of liquor on the ground. He is wearing a silk robe and silk pants underneath and seems to be dead/passed out/unclear?

Emrite checks for a pulse. He is surrounded in a cloud of alcoholic haze. The bottle is 90% empty, and she thinks she knows where that 90% is... He's breathing, but shallowly. This is definitly Vonketosen. As Emrite and Kruuti move him onto the bed, he makes mewling noises and attempts speech, but is massively inebriated.

We see a small bottle of fruit nectar that might've made a good mixer, but not for all of the alcohol that he's consumed. On the other side of the bed, scattered around the floor are bank statement printouts - with considerable red ink. Near the statements is a military officer's sidearm - a charged laser pistol, safety on.

There's lots scattered around. It's densely packed with things accumulated over life. It becomes obvious that he was a pilot. Images displayed in frames, art on the wall, photos of others in flight gear, etc. It will probably take a few hours for him to come out of this, unless we do something else to speed it up. Emrite and Rahim begin to look around the estate for a medkit.

Kruuti checks his pockets and finds his compad, which he's left unlocked. There is a half-composed email/letter. It starts out incoherent _and gets worse_.

`youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuudddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd ............. ;a`

The recipient is already keyed in: **Shenkor Mohejen**.
