## 2020-05-16-S -- Session 001

Our story begins with us unable to move and panicked. Stark chemical smell in the air. Crash couch enveloping our bodies. Klaxons screaming bleeding through the claustrophobic grip of the crash couch, and the ship shudders violently towards the surface of the planet we've never been to before. But it didn't start out like this...

We were individually approached by a Derendali merchant - **Herandor Vonketosen**. Made contact in his private quarters. We eyeball each other over a low table. Each of us had responded to a subtle advertisement for work befitting our talents. Table is laid out with small dishes and drinks. We've been waiting for 45 minutes or so for him to come out of his private quarters and meet us.

**Emrite** - all black jumpsuit. Hair braided and back. Ambiguous and forgettable. Laser pistol at her side.

\*\*Weird not to be carrying some form of personal protection. Need to be able to defend yourself until security forces show. Standard issue rifle is normal, larger weapons are conspicuous. If you're in armor, you're expecting that's necessary.

**Rahim** - Palestinian Han Solo

**Kruuti** - Ellaria Sand. Loose-fitting britches, knee-high boots over flowing top. Pistol at side. Backpack.

Harandor hasn't been in the shipping industry for very long - Vanketosen shipping is about 8 weeks old. In good standing with authorities. Caste system is strictly divided - Military/Psychic, Compulsory service (most people remain here), Discharged/Unable To Serve (Merchants), and Vonketosen is definitely in the merchant class. Makes sense for him to be reaching out to us outside the law, since this is his best opportunity.

Framed Derendali flight suit of significant rank with his name embroidered on the side ofit on the wall, in a place of honor & highlighted, when we came in. Framed case next to it of Derendali medals of service. He's a decorated captain. Weird that it didn't show up when we looked him up.

Food is running low, have cooled, and drinks are nearly gone. He still hasn't come out.

When we showed up, an electronic call & response let us in. Unintelligent service drone served us food & drink. It's an expensive residential area. It's a receiving area with incense burning. Incense is like art hanging on the wall, and this incense is good and expensive - lit fresh when we showed up.

We're looking through a well-stocked kitchen, when we hear a thump come from upstairs - a single heavy object being dropped on carpet. Emrite suggests checking it out, and we head upstairs. We smell the strong scent of alcohol. We find a figure hanging torso off the bed with a mostly-empty bottle of liquor on the ground. He is wearing a silk robe and silk pants underneath and seems to be dead/passed out/unclear?

Emrite checks for a pulse. He is surrounded in a cloud of alcoholic haze. The bottle is 90% empty, and she thinks she knows where that 90% is... He's breathing, but shallowly. This is definitly Vonketosen. As Emrite and Kruuti move him onto the bed, he makes mewling noises and attempts speech, but is massively inebriated.

We see a small bottle of fruit nectar that might've made a good mixer, but not for all of the alcohol that he's consumed. On the other side of the bed, scattered around the floor are bank statement printouts - with considerable red ink. Near the statements is a military officer's sidearm - a charged laser pistol, safety on.

There's lots scattered around. It's densely packed with things accumulated over life. It becomes obvious that he was a pilot. Images displayed in frames, art on the wall, photos of others in flight gear, etc. It will probably take a few hours for him to come out of this, unless we do something else to speed it up. Emrite and Rahim begin to look around the estate for a medkit.

Kruuti checks his pockets and finds his compad, which he's left unlocked. There is a half-composed email/letter. It starts out incoherent _and gets worse_.

`youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuudddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd ............. ;a`

The recipient is already keyed in: **Shenkor Mohejen**. Kruuti has never heard this name before. She pokes into the rest of the emails. There are so many past due notices in his inbox that it looks like a spam folder. It appears that he's a broke person attempting to stay in high society. Limo services, air taxes, expensive food delivery, etc.

Kruuti looks at the financial documents and figures out that most of his wealth was in investments - hugely diversified - but within the same week, his banks told him that "Due to a discrepency in your accounts and issues with the origins of your investments, we have zeroed out your accounts."

Rahim and Emrite find a medkit, but almost all the drugs have already been taken. There is one dose remaining of a mild stimulant in a single-use spray - like two more pills at the bottom of a container of caffeine pills. In looking in his wardrobe, we find a military full dress uniform.

Rahim stims Vonketosen, who promptly vomits all over him, begins to try to throttle him, and curses Shenkor. Rahim manages to push him back onto the bed, where is sobbing like a child. Emrite asks him if he's ok, and if he would like a shower. His service drone offers laundry service, which Rahim takes adavantage of. We hear crying from the shower, and shortly thereafer, Vonketosen emerges dressed and cleaned. Rahim gets a suit.

He's destitute. He can't afford the house, his cars have been repossessed, and he expects to be evicted. We are his literal last hope. He'll be on the street shortly. He's a desparate man. Emrite asks what he needs. Crudely put, he needs more money than God. He believes that he knows where to find it, in return for a slice of it.

He asked if we have heard of Shenkor, a Coven Intelligence Agent, and his rival for a promotion in the agency. He learned of his situation before Vonketosen did - a fortune built on lies. Thought to be shipping magnates, built upon a ponzi scheme. He inherited his wealth. Was "a motherfucker of a pilot," but inherited his money.

He was up for a position training pilots for intel/observation craft. Mohejen figured out the false fortune, and saw fit to alert all institutions simultaneously. We are to be the instruments on his revenge. In exchange for being the viscious hand of retribution against this cumstain of a man, we will be made rich beyond our wildest dreams. He's landlocked - but we are not. He knows about several opportunities he meant to pursue after his service to the coven.

He knows of a cache of pre-tech on Hartoum, one jump away. The locals are... questionably aware of it. He believes that we can get there, recover it, and bring it back to him. Or, at least, firm evidence of its existence. He can leverage his reputation to retreive the rest and make us fabulously wealthy. Why not take it for ourselves? Vonketosen believes that when he bonded with his familiar, more of the animal made it into him. He's an accomplished telepath, and suggests that we not end up in the same room.

When we leave, he will be consuming the remainder of his alcohol and getting so drunk that he will forget the majority of the conversation. When we accomplish what he's sent us to do, we will give him a passphrase, and give him a treasure to double his initial fortunes. We cannot bring it off Hartoum, but he could make that happen.

The pre-tech can see things that travel over the speed of light. If we can locate and secure the observatory, he should be able to outmaneuver Shenkor and make us rich. The best he can tell us is that it's somewhere near Karomir, a simple village. Stories of the observatory are traced back to this village. We're probably not the only ones looking. He has some hard currency remaining to get us transport. We can't get our own ship, but should be able to get passage on a trading ship. We would have standard passenger fare.

He believes he would be able to offer us 1MM credits of astronautical work at the shipyards - enough for a reasonably valuable ship. We agree, and he heads out to his kitchen. We put together an order for some extra stuff, and it should be delivered to the **Benorgu Beauty** - a medkit, a Hartoum survival kit, a shear rifle, 5 line shunts, trade metals, and a bioscanner.

We get pings about 10m after we step outside with flight itineraries to board the ship in 16 hours. It's a trading ship with passenger service, and is bound for Hartoum and Points Further. It drills into the system, ferries people with the shipboard shuttle, and drills out.

We leave, and go to a bar to get to know each other a little better.

## -- RESEARCH --

Emrite pulls out her dataslab and looks for information on Shenkor Mohejen. She finds a reference to an awards ceremony when he entered the intelligence service and earned a high medal for achievement. In the photo, he looks extraordinarily nondescript. Military haircut, no tattoos or scars. He's a man of slight build.

Herendor isn't mentioned much. His entry to pilot candidacy school, but they don't publish much regarding their military exploits. His most recent hit is a public news article of how he was dismissed from military service dishonorably two months ago. Within two weeks, he was dishonorably discharged and all of his investments vanished. His parents died about a year ago. His father was a business magnate, and his death was notable.
