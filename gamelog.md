## 2020-05-16-S -- Session 001

Our story begins with us unable to move and panicked. Stark chemical smell in the air. Crash couch enveloping our bodies. Klaxons screaming bleeding through the claustrophobic grip of the crash couch, and the ship shudders violently towards the surface of the planet we've never been to before. But it didn't start out like this...

We were individually approached by a Derendali merchant - **Herandor Vonketosen**. Made contact in his private quarters. We eyeball each other over a low table. Each of us had responded to a subtle advertisement for work befitting our talents. Table is laid out with small dishes and drinks. We've been waiting for 45 minutes or so for him to come out of his private quarters and meet us.

**Emrite** - all black jumpsuit. Hair braided and back. Ambiguous and forgettable. Laser pistol at her side.

\*\*Weird not to be carrying some form of personal protection. Need to be able to defend yourself until security forces show. Standard issue rifle is normal, larger weapons are conspicuous. If you're in armor, you're expecting that's necessary.

**Rahim** - Palestinian Han Solo

**Kruti** - Ellaria Sand. Loose-fitting britches, knee-high boots over flowing top. Pistol at side. Backpack.

Harandor hasn't been in the shipping industry for very long - Vanketosen shipping is about 8 weeks old. In good standing with authorities. Caste system is strictly divided - Military/Psychic, Compulsory service (most people remain here), Discharged/Unable To Serve (Merchants), and Vonketosen is definitely in the merchant class. Makes sense for him to be reaching out to us outside the law, since this is his best opportunity.

Framed Derendali flight suit of significant rank with his name embroidered on the side ofit on the wall, in a place of honor & highlighted, when we came in. Framed case next to it of Derendali medals of service. He's a decorated captain. Weird that it didn't show up when we looked him up.

Food is running low, have cooled, and drinks are nearly gone. He still hasn't come out.

When we showed up, an electronic call & response let us in. Unintelligent service drone served us food & drink. It's an expensive residential area. It's a receiving area with incense burning. Incense is like art hanging on the wall, and this incense is good and expensive - lit fresh when we showed up.

We're looking through a well-stocked kitchen, when we hear a thump come from upstairs - a single heavy object being dropped on carpet. Emrite suggests checking it out, and we head upstairs. We smell the strong scent of alcohol. We find a figure hanging torso off the bed with a mostly-empty bottle of liquor on the ground. He is wearing a silk robe and silk pants underneath and seems to be dead/passed out/unclear?

Emrite checks for a pulse. He is surrounded in a cloud of alcoholic haze. The bottle is 90% empty, and she thinks she knows where that 90% is... He's breathing, but shallowly. This is definitly Vonketosen. As Emrite and Kruti move him onto the bed, he makes mewling noises and attempts speech, but is massively inebriated.

We see a small bottle of fruit nectar that might've made a good mixer, but not for all of the alcohol that he's consumed. On the other side of the bed, scattered around the floor are bank statement printouts - with considerable red ink. Near the statements is a military officer's sidearm - a charged laser pistol, safety on.

There's lots scattered around. It's densely packed with things accumulated over life. It becomes obvious that he was a pilot. Images displayed in frames, art on the wall, photos of others in flight gear, etc. It will probably take a few hours for him to come out of this, unless we do something else to speed it up. Emrite and Rahim begin to look around the estate for a medkit.

Kruti checks his pockets and finds his compad, which he's left unlocked. There is a half-composed email/letter. It starts out incoherent _and gets worse_.

`youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuudddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd ............. ;a`

The recipient is already keyed in: **Shenkor Mohejen**. Kruti has never heard this name before. She pokes into the rest of the emails. There are so many past due notices in his inbox that it looks like a spam folder. It appears that he's a broke person attempting to stay in high society. Limo services, air taxes, expensive food delivery, etc.

Kruti looks at the financial documents and figures out that most of his wealth was in investments - hugely diversified - but within the same week, his banks told him that "Due to a discrepency in your accounts and issues with the origins of your investments, we have zeroed out your accounts."

Rahim and Emrite find a medkit, but almost all the drugs have already been taken. There is one dose remaining of a mild stimulant in a single-use spray - like two more pills at the bottom of a container of caffeine pills. In looking in his wardrobe, we find a military full dress uniform.

Rahim stims Vonketosen, who promptly vomits all over him, begins to try to throttle him, and curses Shenkor. Rahim manages to push him back onto the bed, where is sobbing like a child. Emrite asks him if he's ok, and if he would like a shower. His service drone offers laundry service, which Rahim takes adavantage of. We hear crying from the shower, and shortly thereafer, Vonketosen emerges dressed and cleaned. Rahim gets a suit.

He's destitute. He can't afford the house, his cars have been repossessed, and he expects to be evicted. We are his literal last hope. He'll be on the street shortly. He's a desparate man. Emrite asks what he needs. Crudely put, he needs more money than God. He believes that he knows where to find it, in return for a slice of it.

He asked if we have heard of Shenkor, a Coven Intelligence Agent, and his rival for a promotion in the agency. He learned of his situation before Vonketosen did - a fortune built on lies. Thought to be shipping magnates, built upon a ponzi scheme. He inherited his wealth. Was "a motherfucker of a pilot," but inherited his money.

He was up for a position training pilots for intel/observation craft. Mohejen figured out the false fortune, and saw fit to alert all institutions simultaneously. We are to be the instruments on his revenge. In exchange for being the viscious hand of retribution against this cumstain of a man, we will be made rich beyond our wildest dreams. He's landlocked - but we are not. He knows about several opportunities he meant to pursue after his service to the coven.

He knows of a cache of pre-tech on Hartoum, one jump away. The locals are... questionably aware of it. He believes that we can get there, recover it, and bring it back to him. Or, at least, firm evidence of its existence. He can leverage his reputation to retreive the rest and make us fabulously wealthy. Why not take it for ourselves? Vonketosen believes that when he bonded with his familiar, more of the animal made it into him. He's an accomplished telepath, and suggests that we not end up in the same room.

When we leave, he will be consuming the remainder of his alcohol and getting so drunk that he will forget the majority of the conversation. When we accomplish what he's sent us to do, we will give him a passphrase, and give him a treasure to double his initial fortunes. We cannot bring it off Hartoum, but he could make that happen.

The pre-tech can see things that travel over the speed of light. If we can locate and secure the observatory, he should be able to outmaneuver Shenkor and make us rich. The best he can tell us is that it's somewhere near Carromir, a simple village. Stories of the observatory are traced back to this village. We're probably not the only ones looking. He has some hard currency remaining to get us transport. We can't get our own ship, but should be able to get passage on a trading ship. We would have standard passenger fare.

He believes he would be able to offer us 1MM credits of astronautical work at the shipyards - enough for a reasonably valuable ship. We agree, and he heads out to his kitchen. We put together an order for some extra stuff, and it should be delivered to the **Benorgu Beauty** - a medkit, a Hartoum survival kit, a shear rifle, 5 line shunts, trade metals, and a bioscanner.

We get pings about 10m after we step outside with flight itineraries to board the ship in 16 hours. It's a trading ship with passenger service, and is bound for Hartoum and Points Further. It drills into the system, ferries people with the shipboard shuttle, and drills out.

We leave, and go to a bar to get to know each other a little better.

## -- RESEARCH --

Emrite pulls out her dataslab and looks for information on Shenkor Mohejen. She finds a reference to an awards ceremony when he entered the intelligence service and earned a high medal for achievement. In the photo, he looks extraordinarily nondescript. Military haircut, no tattoos or scars. He's a man of slight build.

Herendor isn't mentioned much. His entry to pilot candidacy school, but they don't publish much regarding their military exploits. His most recent hit is a public news article of how he was dismissed from military service dishonorably two months ago. Within two weeks, he was dishonorably discharged and all of his investments vanished. His parents died about a year ago. His father was a business magnate, and his death was notable.

We learn a few things about one another:

```
Emrite spent 15 years of her life traveling with her bounty hunter godmother, a talented psychic who taught her what she could.

While employed with the Merchant Marines, Rahim mapped a faster route between Jerash and Vindelicorum.

Kruti is a procurer and augmentor of goods. She's not a drug dealer, but she can get you what you want.
```

We decide not to dig further into Shenkor, and head for the Beauty.

## -- The Beauty --

The Beauty is a sizable frigate with a considerable weapon mounted. We head through the crowds to the ship. We board, find our seats (in a block next to each other). The docking clamps release, and we take off. We head towards the edge of the system and begin the spike drill to Hartoum.

Our ticket includes a coffin-hotel sleeping space and meager food. There's a common eating space that we eat at in shifts. Common knowledge is that people are going to Hartoum for a pilgrimage. People spend some time on Hartoum, which is deliberately very simple - TL 2, Industrial Revolution - so that they can live a simple life for religious contemplation.

There was never a jump gate here. The colony ship in orbit was a small, floating city. Portions of it are still powered, and people live on it. Some of it functions as an abbey or monestary, serving a religion that sprang up around the settling of this sector. Chunks of the ship have fallen from orbit and survived.

A ship with standard scanning ablities and a telemetry will be able to look at a planet and get relatively simple data back - atmosphere, geology, advanced energy-using surface communities, ships in orbit, and features designed to attract orbital interest. We'd need dedicated scanning tech to find things from orbit.

We come to and are able to emerge from the crash couch into the blinding light on the surface of Hartoum. Something broke - a tremendous bang - on the shuttle, and we spiraled down fast enough to pin us to the floor. At the last moment, emergency safety protocols engaged, and the cabin filled with impact-absorbing foam. Also contains a potent sedative.

We're standing in a large crater. The shuttle, that held 50 people, and is scattered around the crater. The largest chunk at the bottom is burning heavily. The cargo portion cracked, and there is a line of baggage around 800 ft long. The sun is overhead and beautiful, the air is fresh and breathable, and a deer looks down on us from the top of the crater. We realize that we're ravenous - like we haven't eaten in days - maybe haven't drank in that long, either.

It looks like there's considerable blood along the other crash couches. Crash foam is meant to be tenuous life support system, but also built to decay before they run out of oxygen. It takes 4 days to degrade to the point where the foam will break and we can move naturally.

There's a lot of cratered, shattered foam around with blood on the outside. It went into several big portions and other tiny portions. 3 main chunks fragmented the way it was supposed to. It looks like someone went through the baloons of safety foam, cut or burned them open, and executed the people inside the pods. There are clear marks of laser fire on the bodies inside.

The other poeple in our bloom of foam were killed. A chunk of the shuttle fell on our forner of the pod, and we just happened to be under a chunk of ship. It seems as though we were assumed dead or crushed, and we escaped whatever befell those who traveled with us.

We're in an environment like the scottish highlands. We're all but certain that we're the only survivors. 75 helpless people were killed by whoever raided this crash site. We head towards the cargo field.

A lot survived. The full furrow of the ship is 2,000 ft long or so. Most of the cargo is clothes, effects, etc. Some hard case cargo containers have survived.

Over an hour and a half, we're able to put together a pile of things that weren't shredded by the crash, including our cargo container. Emrite opens up the crate. The internal framing is destroyed.

The medkit, shear rifle, and trade metals survived.

The survival kit, line shunts, and bioscanner were destroyed.

We're able to crack into the first class portions of food on the shuttle. We have 10 person/days of food and water.

As we check out the shattered remnatns of the shuttle, we come across the portion of the shuttle that contained the escape pods. There are 6 pods. 5 are still attached and crushed beyond repair - 1 is missing.

## 2020-05-23-S -- Session 002

We are in the smoking crater of the ship's boat. Something terrible happened on our way down, and so we have awakened several days after the crash. It's roughly 4AM.

"The crash has really thrown a wrench in your plans."

We stand on the lip of the crater. Emrite uses the light on her metatool to look at the area around us and notices that the ground around us is incredibly muddy. That's odd, since we're at the top of a hill... The trees around us look odd as well. Those near us have mud splashed on them up around mid-thigh height. There is something splashing in a nearby mud puddle.

Kruuti takes out her light as well and we see a mostly-translucent speckled 6-tentacled cephalopod. Nearby, another also splashes in the puddle. It's a muggy bog. We're a good 75 ft above the plains below us.

We see lots of broken trees, but they aren't pointed towards the crater. Kruuti attempts to fix the bioscanner and accomplishes her task in about an hour. Rahim figures out that the cockpit isn't disintegrated on impact, and landed belly-first. There may be salvagable data or systems in that cockpit. He also knows that he doesn't know much about the squids, but he's fairly certain they don't belong here.

Emrite searches the perimeter, armed with her shear rifle and laser pistol. She finds the burning trail of stuff behind the ship. She makes her way down the hill and gets the sense that there is considerable water here, flowing back to the NW - in the direction the shuttle crashed down from. She's about 3/4 of the way around when she finds the body of a sheep... in a large tree... 18ft off the ground...speared on a broken branch...

It's been dead for a while - smelt before seen, and the tree is spattered at least that far in black mud. The sheep is outside the splash range of the ship's crash, and has been dead for longer than 4 days.

Rahim makes his way to the cockpit. There's no body inside. Blood everywhere, but not bodies. There are holes in the flight console like someone shot it with a very powerful weapon. There is intact equipment, and Rahim is able to access the shuttle's computer.

- Last known location

  - Rahim assists via INT Pilot
  - Kruuti figures out the ship went down just 26 km NW of the colony

- External force or mechanical failure

  - The shuttle had a series of catastrophic failures in sequence.
  - 10m before atmo, atmo sealant failure, atmo vented hard. To keep the cabin alive, the pilots executed a hard dive into atmo, which would shred the outside of the shuttle but keep passengers oxygenated. Shuttle hull badly damaged.
  - Just after atmo, pilot lifesigns flatlined. Severe damage to instrumentation.
  - After atmo was completed, 1 escape pod jettisoned (15 person capacity, 3 people inside). No other pods jettisoned before impact.

We realize that there have been no bodies left.

We expect full sunrise at 7am. We realize that the bog level is high, and that this isn't normal. Something has gone terribly wrong with this landscape. There are additional drowned sheep in the trees, and the trees are awash with black mud. Rivulets of water run everywhere. It's clear that there was a terrible flood here.

We decide to take some time and resources (spare parts, shuttle seats, escape pod engines, etc.) to create a crude hovercraft. We salvage enough energy in a B-cell to power the craft for 4 days. We board the Gender Neutral and Rahim takes the pilot's seat.

On our maiden voyage, the craft works! It stayes together, rattles a bunch, and is propelled by maneuvering pods from the escape pod. It makes a noise like a steam train in a tunnel, and rattles so hard it feels like one might chip a tooth. At some point, we hear a clang and a splash, and none of us can figure out what fell off...

The sun is high, we are all hot, and catching bugs in our teeth. Our passing is a vulgar affront to a fairly quiet scene as we realize that a recent flood has devestated the highlands. Whatever trees are still rooted are centers of debris islands - fallen trees, dead livestock, etc.

The craft works better on the water, but we begin to smell rot. We pass a pale, naked, human body - and then more. Scavenging birds circle overhead, scattered by the sound of our craft. Faces turn towards us as we approach where Carromir used to be. People are wading through the water up to their waists, chests. They're naked or half-naked, some in nightclothes... There's a river here that has broken its banks. Fish and strange squid everywhere. Birds love the squid, so they're not rotting in too many places.

We hear a bell ring out ahead of us and see houses piled together. We think we arrived at Carromir. As we're approaching, the water pushes us downstream atop a river heading through the middle of the settlement. A tree suddenly rises up like we had stepped on a rake. Rahim cranks the wheel. An engine bottle rockets away. We jerk away from the tree, clipping the ass of the craft, but avoid smashing full-on into the tree. We are intact, but rattled. We have arrived at what remains of Carromir.

Everything is stained with mold and lichen. People all over shout, wail, and haul makeshift skiffs of their things. People are barely getting their shit together from the catastrophic flood. Nearest us, an old man drags a drowned body onto makeshift docs cobbled together from broken beams. To our right, a priest from the pilgrimage site clings to a log, shrieking "Everything is ruined, oh god..." etc. etc. and seems to have run out of reasons to get out of the water. A woman rafting atop a large door is trying to keep several people atop her craft.

We're still far out from the buildings - 5-10 minutes - and haven't found dry land yet. Almost all water is knee-waist deep, and the center of the river is tree deep.

Life here is a complete mess.

Several miles NE of Carromir is a visible column of steam. The river continues on, but the people are devastated. There isn't much we can do for them, so we continue along.

Closer to the building are more people. Two women on a low hillock. One is screaming, audible over the roar of our apocalypse boat, often repeating "UNCLEAN MEAT". Next to her, paying apparently no attention, is an ancient crone of a woman with a corpse next to her, grabbing it by the head, and staring intently into its mouth. We pass them by as well. The screaming woman sees us, points at our craft, and continues to scream about "UNCLEAN MEAT".

We pass the remains of a building on a muddy hill, barely sticking out of the water. A man, almost as old as the crone, stands - dressed well, soaked to the bone. He is using his bare hands to scrape out shallow graves for bodies laid over the hill. Next to him, in a half-wrecked buidling, is a woman in her mid-20s, surrounded by a screaming group of 7-9yo children. They're all shouting at her, asking her where their parents are. She's frantically trying to calm them, and looks at our craft with an uninterpretable glance.

We decide to stop and have a chat with the schoolmarm. 2/4 walls were ripped away, and the building is half-collapsed. She wears a soaked dress, shivering. The children are also soaked, spattered in mud. Kruuti bioscans the teacher and finds she's in relative good health - hungry, cold, but not poisoned or dying.

Emrite asks what happened, and the woman says there was a flood. The dam burst, the water came and washed away the town. She wants to know if we have any food, and that the children are starving. Kruti asks when this happened, and it has apparently been 6-7 days. Emrite asks about the dam. She points vaguely upriver, but doesn't know anything about the dam. She asks if we're there to help, and Emrite responds no. The woman looks crestfallen. She asks if we can take them to safety, but we can't.

She seems lost in her own thoughts, and the children begin screaming again. **Miss Trowen** begins sobbing as the children overwhelm her again. We push off and head upriver towards the dam.

Along the way, about halfway towards the cluster of buildings, a large mound of freshly turned soil with pale limbs sticking out of it, moves and twitches. Near the pile is a tall, thin man, down on one knee, with his arm around a small child, talking to him conspiratorily. On the other side is the biggest group of people we've seen so far, hauling on beams of wood out of a stack. We see one teetering towards the top, and attempt to warn them. When that doesn't work, Emrite tries to hit it with her shear rifle in burst mode. The shear rifle makes absolutely no noise except for an external mechanism marking off three rounds from the battery. The structural beam just... falls apart.

We begin to enter the cluster of buildings, a rural village center. Higher buildings have planks across rooves or floors for traversal. People are taking notice of our roaring devastation vessel. Buildings are wood, painted to look like stone.

We see a guy with a messenger bag with multiple compads and dataslabs on the roof of a building, looking out with binoculars at the column of steam. There is a virutally naked, raggedly thin child creeping up behind him, and he looks completely unsuspecting. Meanwhile, a large crowd is gathered between two connected buildings with a muddy courtyard between them. They're shouting in anger at one man wearing spacers' overalls, and they appear to be about to actually lynch him.

Rahim tries to warn the guy, but ends up accidentally distracting him. The kid takes advantage of the opening and takes a compad from his bag.

A moment of listening to the people are accusing the man of being a thief, that he stole bread, etc. We disembark and approach the crowd from the rear.

In the mud at their feet is a messenger bag spilling out the same kind of preserved meals we had from our ship. It's been stepped on several times, and has 60/man/days of high-density food. The stencil on them says "The Latipan". Kruti picks up the bag, takes 6 units out, and makes her way to the front of the crowd. Emrite uses her telekinetic abilities to mitigate the noose temporarily. Kruti begins passing out food and tries to disperse the crowd.

The crowd quickly dies down until the last ones remaining are the prime lynch executors. A shock of realization comes over them, and they release the man. They look at Kruti. One asks where the food came from, and she responds that they were in such a hurry to kill him they stepped over their own food.

The name on his coverall is Kashusko, Max. Tattoos crawl up out of his coverall from his neck to behind his ear. They are floral themed, and they cover most of his body. He shakily gets to his feet, thanks Kruti, and takes some time to catch his breath. She distributes the remaining food, and they disperse. Towards the end, the woman who had had the noose in her hand, takes her food and apologizes to Max, but seems to think he would get it. He smiles, and says he gets it, "but maybe not twice, alright?"

Kruti bioscans him, and he seems generally bruised and sore, but will be ok. He says the whole place went insane about a week ago. A wall of water swept through. They were doing a medical dropoff. Blast from upriver. He heard it go off. Nobody fights onworld normally. It's usually a safe run. They go to take cover, and he sees the wall of water. Slammed into the town like a fist. Their ship got tumbled, and they'll be here months. The food gets scarce and they're treating each other miserably. This bag of food was sold by one of the idiot deckhands. Captain sent him to recover it, and they flipped shit saying he stole it from them. He'll vouch for us to his captain.

He says the people who live her are weird - and he chooses to live in space. These people choose to live 2000 years in the past. Emrite tells him we crash landed and he seems astonished. Apparently, they saw us come down like a comet. He says Captain Zarathusa is a sharp man, fair, but be polite. He's at the end of his rope right now between the people and the deckhand, shit's nuts.

We take him on our hovercraft over to the ship that has rolled into the center of town on a 30deg cant and a 45deg angle, wedged between two buildings. Where the wings were torn, the space between has been crudely filled in with expanding foam. Ladders hang for access and tarps hang for sun shields. Workmen shout and locals mill about shouting at people in the ship.

## 2020-05-30-S -- Session 003

Max takes us through Carromir and we see the devastation and recovery. Off to the far NE, there is a plume of steam that has reached up so high it has hit an atmospheric ceiling and has umbrella'd out into a thunderhead.

He leads us through the town and takes us to The Latipan, where there is a heated debate going on between a crowd roughly 1/3 the size of the lynch mob and Captain Zarathusa. She is holding a thorougly modded automatic laser rifle in her hands and looking thoroughly unimpressed. She has the calm demeanor of someone who know's they're holding a lethal weapon.

She appreciates that they're short on supplies, but they're not food merchants and they don't have enough to survive, themselves. There will be consequences for those who sold. They weren't overcharged, it was a crime for them to be charged in the first place. There will be no further food sales. The Carromirans are unhappy, and she asserts that they _will_ disperse -- **now**. She flicks the safety off on her rifle. Lots of angry shouting, but they do disperse.

Max looks uncomfortable. He says it'll be best if we're nice. They have a short-range network for text comms. We opt to take some time to repair the hovercraft, make connections, and shore up the safety features on the Gender Neutral. He doesn't know what they're eating with their farmland underwater. He's seeing lots of meat in the stewpots and he doesn't know where it's coming from... T_T Max heads back to the hatch on that Latipan, shouts up, and they crew lowers a rope ladder of extension cords to bring him up.

### Slang Highlight: Iron === Firearms, Hardware

We look to start scavenging materials from around town to repair and advance the Gender Neutral. In almost an hour, we're able to repair the craft. As we're finishing up, Kashusko pings us to let us know that the captain has calmed down and wants to see us aboard the Latipan.

We are able to dock the Gender Neutral close to the Latipan. The captain is waiting for us in Secure Tech clothing under coveralls with a sidearm. She has a hairpiece or headdress on her brow. Max emerges, talks to the crewmen, and they roll down the rope ladder. As we come aboard, it's pretty packed. We're in an upside-down ship. Three crew members (MMF) ask us to divest ourselves of any weapons. We agree, and our weapons go into a storage locker.

The ship is funhouse of upside-down doors and bulkheads and such. We enter a room with Captain Zarathusa and Max. We introduce ourselves, and she asks if they're sworn in or lapsed - active members of the military or not. They answer that they're lapsed (Emrite) and merchant (Kruti). She asks why we're here, and Rahim tells her we're on a retrieval mission for a few small items for a Derendali noble. She realizes we're freelancers, and says she may have use of us.

She wants The Latipan running again. She knows we were out cold when the dam blew, and believes military-grade explosives (phased plasma charge, gravitic force, gravtank) would be required to take out a Terran Mandate dam over 600 years old. She wants to know what happened. They have food on The Latipan for a while, and the people aren't starving but are afraid. She gives us a charged B cell in exchange for us investigating the dam and giving her scrapings of the char and a full report. She needs money getting the ship running again, and it doesn't pay for itself. In exchange, we'll get 500c a head with the data dump. Emrite asks for some spare pieces and safety gear for the Gender Neutral.

Kruti asks about their next stop, and she responds that they were coming through Derendal through Hartoum to Lians Trimph to Euripides through other planets to batamia(???). If they get off-planet, they'll take us with them. They can probably afford to make another Derendal stop.

We are not the only freelancers seen around Carromir. Many people don't look like pilgrims these days. If we leave for the dam, we'll be noticed, and should be careful. If we have anything we can sell, she can move it for us if she can get The Latipan off-planet. The remnants of the dam may have usable materials for repairs on The Latipan. We don't need to bring it back with us, but can toss a beacon on it.

It should at least be something to get the ship upright - most likely a controlled demo of the building it's resting on. She can feed us, but there are Terms and Conditions: We can't keep it in the ship-marked packaging, so it'll go bad more quickly. Max will set us up with basic needs.

They're persona non grata, but are willing to offer expertise and engineering in recovery efforts.

Comms are fragged except for short-range network.

Hull is battered, but not a complete lost cause. It's too awkward to launch, but could be repaired and righted and be spaceworthy.

Kruti also secures us a pressure tent.

She gives us a link to the ship's transponder, so we can ping the ship if we find working radio equipment. The only reason they have a LAN at all is that they repurposed someone's PS9-equivalent to rig it up.

We get a brief tour through the ship before Max hooks us up. We get a full B cell - enough to power the Gender Neutral for 2 weeks. We're given a canvas bag without the ship's mark with unwrapped rations rewrapped in extruded plastic bags. There are 5 days of food for all 3 of us (15 total units) in the bag. We also get an expandable pressure tent - this **is** marked with the Latipan's ship mark, which Max promptly covers in duct tape. He escorts us to the air lock where we receive our weapons and we are free to depart the ship.

We decide to leave for the dam. The column of steam is actually rising from further north from the dam. The water heads vaguely northeast towards the dam, but the steam is NNW from there.

The valley floor winds up towards the dam, and the land has become a flood plain. There are chunks of houses floating down - wreckage of other villages and towns. We follow the path of the river to avoid the trees coming up from the water. We're passing other spacers, mostly. Predators and scavengers are out eating dead fish and such. More squids and pike in the water, squids camoflauging as we pass.

We're heading upriver, fighting a strong current. We come upon 2 men facing each other, standing on the surface of the water with no apparent support. Each has a strange device in their hands - like their hand was fitted inside a basketball with a grip on the inside. They are furious with each other - pointing, shouting, and spitting in rage.

We pull closer. Nearby, we can see a small boat fitted with an outboard motor hidden in the reeds. The one closer to the W bank is... plump. He speaks Mandate Common with an unplacable accent with this device with shaking antennae on the end of it. "Pompous shitbag, overfunded fuckbutt" is said. Every violent gesture moves the water. The other looks anemic, like he's barely standing - but that's his default. He's flushed, and wearing a hat like a collapsed flan. "You took my funding, both stuck here with one boat and two devices and not enough to get the job done..." Rem Koolhaüs? His handwaves also create frothing water.

As we approach, they say they want us to observe their duel. We want to know more... They say we're clearly from offworld from our outfits - which are blasphemous - but are educated? They're anthropologists, studying the precursor race that lived on this planet before the Terran Mandate, with low opinions of the colonists. He found that his cohort farts too much eating the local food and takes up too much space in the canoe. Emrite asks how they're standing on the water. They look down and realize the bridge they're standing on is sinking. The fat one wishes the thin one is eaten by squid, and we realize they're on a bridge.

It's not his work that's impeded by the dam, it's the other one's work who thinks that they arrival of the Terran mandate turned them into a decent civilization. They're really fighting because they've been in a canoe for 5 days, spent all their money on the devices, and have decided that they can only solve their differences by dueling to the death. They each offer us money to kill the other and say the other won the duel. He says Rem Koolhaüs is a serial pedophile, but there is no proof, he's just trying to besmirch him. The balls they're using are psi-tech, harnessing an ability to manipulate water.

They were approaching the dam when it was suddenly deleted. He gestures towards a 4-ft fin rising out of the water, saying that it will probably tear his colleague apart. Emrite offers to take one of them aboard our craft and leave the other the canoe, and they seem pretty set on killing one another.

The floor of the canoe is carpeted in wrappers. There's no mechanical damage to the canoe, it's just out of gas. The creature is coming closer and closer. Emrite realizes it must be 20' long and is charging at the anthropologists. The creature hurls itself out of the water at one of the academics and appears to be an enormous Hartoumian River Pike. It looms with open jaws towards Rem Koolhaüs - the fat one.

Rahim fires at the pike, hitting it for minor damage through a fin. Emrite misses. Remtries to hit it with a water construct, but doesn't seem to affect it much. Kruti ties the canoe to the Gender Neutral.

Rahim misses the fish. Emrite manages to hit the fish in the eye, prompting it to toss Remback to the bridge. Remtakes an item that looks like two pencils end to end, activating it and throwing it towards the pike. It explodes! The fish is now scored with a gridded network of lines, chunks of it floating in the water. The fish soaks us with river water, Ruskin's hat further rekt. The pike flees. Kruuti ignores the fish and asks Rem for his medkit, that he doesn't have. She uses his belt to tourniquet his leg.

We look for a place to lay low for the evening. Some land to the east might do,

Kruti stablizes Rem and dresses his wound. Emrite talks to Ruskin Behavior, asking what they were looking for. They didn't have enough fuel to get the whole way up the river, and his maps were outdated. They were trying to find remnants of glittering golden tombs. He thinks that the Terran Mandate civilized them, though they were able to keep some of their primitive practices. After many years of selective breeding, they were something that once was human. Koolhaüs says he thinks they were more advanced.

## 2020-06-13-S -- Session 004

We've found a place to camp and plan out our evening. The night passes coldly. The scholars demand a spot in the tent, but otherwise keep the peace for the evening. There's a low-lying fog as we wake to the river still overflowing its banks. We pack out, unhook the Gender Neutral, and continue on. Emrite spent the evening with one of the devices, but didn't uncover any additional functionality.

We continue on and see a church, rotated 90 degrees onto its side - the steeple is a broken crystal lense. The sides of the church seem whole, but the door is 10 ft up and closed. The bottom has enough stacked against it that we couldn't make our own entrance immediately.

It is surrounded by giant toads (roughly 20, about the size of obese men) that have obviously feasted on corpses, to the point where several have exploded and died from ridiculous overeating.

We then see two children huddled on a large metal casket coming down the river. Rahim pilots the Gender Neutral to move them over to the shore. As we lay them out and begin to tend to their health, Kruuti and Emrite realize that they bear a major familial resemblence to the guy Emrite saved from the falling beam with the shear rifle.

We turn our attention to the box, which is caked with mud and detritis. We clear away the dirt and find ourselves looking at someone's face. We've exposed a porthole on the broad face of the box and are looking through the window at a very old face - hairless and wrinkled. He's not rotted or obviously dead, but isn't moving and seems sleeping or unresponsive. He's wearing a hospital gown or other simple garment. We find what look like elaborate, stenciled markings on the side. It's definitely metal, and has connections ports for some kinds of cables or gas nozzles or something. Between Rahim and Kruuti, we figure out it's a long-term life support or stasis pod. Gas nozzles suggest gaseous medium. If he's dead, he's perfectly preserved. It's not breached or corroded. Emrite hooks up to it with her dataslab and figures out it's a suspension pod, and was last updated 550 years ago. This is Terran Mandate tech. The readout says:

### Sarcophagus-Class Argon Suspension Crypt

### Occupant: Client, "Haranana, Ambato"

The anthropologists are so engrossed in their current argument with each other that they haven't even noticed we stopped, let alone the children or the suspension pod. When asked, they won't admit that they don't know anything about this guy, but insist that the other doesn't know anything, either.

Emrite finds a file system in the sarcophagus containing a journal and last will and testament for the client - encrypted and password-proteceed. She takes some time to plan out a hack to access them - failing at first, but succeeding immediately after.

His will is written entirely conditionally ("If I were to die..."). The journal is more interesting. He was a maintainer on the dam, I think? It concerns funding and beaurocracy, overseen by admin AIs that tried to smooth funding over decades at a time. As funding for the project got more and more erratic, they had to go into suspended animation between supply drops - 4-5 times. By the 4th time it happens, they're no longer very concerned about sleeping away the next several decades. He's like 700 years old by a real-time calendar. The last time, they figured automation would maintain the dam via worker-robots cloned off their brain states such that they would continue to work while they were in animation and update them when they woke up to a new supply drop. The dam exploded, though, and is unlikely to have occured due to failure of the worker robots, etc.

Through context, she manages to get the names of the other overseers. The anthropologists have never heard of any of them, but the naming conventions match up with the Reed People - local historical people. A final piece of information - there is a power source embedded in the suspension crypt - a miniature fusion plant that could power the Latipan.

We decide to make a run back to the town, preferably after exploring the church past the toads. Kruuti hucks a chunk of driftwood. The toad doesn't hop away, but doesn't seem inclined to move very much.

Kruuti consults her precognitive abilities to see if it's a good idea to go through the toads. The vision shows her hanging from the door of the church by herself, above a host of corpse frogs clamoring for her. We decide to try and hit a frog from the hovercraft, and Emrite fires with her laser pistol. She misses, but the toad turns to face us before deeply croaking and beginning to shuffle towards us. It pulls aggro from 4-5 additional toads.

Rahim shoots at a toad and connects. The toad bellows and speeds up, but they're unlikely to reach us any time soon. Kruuti also takes a pistol shot and hits, but it's not enough to kill it. Emrite fires her shear rifle and the toad _unravels_.

She's able to distract the rest of the toads by strategically dismantling a few additional toads, and Rahim drives them up to the church to enter. Emrite fires two additional shots into the floor to create an entrance, and she and Kruuti make their way in. They cut a few pipes and conduits, but are able to enter. The pews have all fallen to the floor (previously a wall). The altar is still intact, and appears to be a smaller version of a jeweler's loupe or detective's magnifying glass as the central focus in the room. The lens was massive enough that it bent the stem when the building tipped. A cabinet door hangs open at the front of the altar. There doesn't appear to be anybody else in the church.

They slide down and walk across the mound of wooden pews to the front. The whole place smells like old river water. Inside the altar, they see what was a well-organized series of baskets that have tumbled into one another. It looks like dried dumpling wrappers in the shape of a stick of gum (like communion wafers). An assortment of unbroken vials of clear liquid. The way the light refracts through the liquid immediately shows that it's clear, but not water. In addition, a thick book with brass endcaps and bound in leather. The cover also looks like the lens on the stem. It's about the size of a modern bible. The symbols are ideograms in the pattern and style of the hexogram qr codes on the sarcophagus. There's an 8x20 grid of them on each page, and was handwritten. Each of the vials is capped in a screw top. Kruuti takes two vials of the liquid and two of the wafers.

Rahim sees that the toads are fully busy eating the other toads, actively getting in the way of their own progress. They check out a closet and find a cassock with a lens on a stem embroidered into it. Kruuti takes a picture of the lens on the altar and the cassock.

We load back up and recover our materials.
