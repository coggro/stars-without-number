## 2020-08-02-S -- Session 011

We radio down to our hirelings and receive no answer on the channel. They may have made off with our craft or could be hiding out now. There are lights moving across the river valley, and a new landscape from under the dam. We expect creatures to arrive within an hour. We opt to examine the door. Kruuti is able to feel the telepathic presense of the underseer she made contact with days ago, and he's an option for defense if we need him. We decide to examine the large door.

We're on top of the dam itself and are looking at a tremendous vault-style door built into the rock wall of the valley. It's large enough to fit The Latipan in sideways if we could open it. There are no observation ports or other holes for anything to come out of. No portcullis, no moat, just a clean swath of dam up to a vault door. Kruuti knocks and may as well be knocking on the mountain.

Rahim tries to identify the amphibious creatures, and realizes they bear a resemblence to the small creatures we saw frozen on the log. The floor of the now-exposed area looks like Kruuti's vision.

The stairs down lead to the level and then below and into the gathering pool behind the dam. Kruuti thinks to look to the portion of the dam where we would expect to find a door based on the model. She approaches to check closely, and is able to find a secret door. It's so well-hidden, it's expected that we never would've been able to find it had we not known it was there. The door won't budge or respond to line shunts, and must be significantly heavy.

Counting the number of folks arriving, the first group likely holds around 8-10 people in it, carrying a lantern or some other light. They bob as though in a watercraft (split between 2 crafts), and are in two separate group. About an hour behind them is a second group moving at the speed of a watercraft, roughly the same size.

Kruuti establishes telepathic contact with the amphibious creature in the headdress. There is a surprisingly complex bouquet of emotions coming from the target. The righteous fury of a soldier about to lead others into battle - not brute tribalism, but a precise mind and considered approach. Thought about why they feel this way. Intensity of emotions suggests a nuanced belief honed to a precise conclusion.

Her telepathy translates what it's saying to its people: "Must nature always be asked to straighten out the mess that man has made?!"

The creature she tries to encroach on has a robust enough mind to fend off telepathic contact.

Kruuti informs the others of the result. After some discussion of what to tell him after making contact, she opts to inform them of the approaching forces (?) by showing him images of the approaching lights. It slows down its gestures for a moment, now just as (if not more) fervent as before. They're no going directly for the golden structures. Kruuti sends an additional message and gets a response in picture-perfect Mandate Common: "Even now, the iniquities of those from beyond our ancestral home continue to plague us. You are not welcome in my mind, among my people, or in my homeland. Begone! Plague us no more in this, our hour of reprisal."

Kruuti asks for elaboration. Usually, people communicate in half-interpretable dreams and such. This creature communicates cleanly, like text off a page. "Diplomacy in the moment of war is an unusual encounter. Were this any other hour and our home not stripped bear by the degredations of those like you, I would wecome you into our kraysh, I would feed you our finest foods, and I would entertain you as the chief I am. But this is our final hour, and the Reed People will be made to suffer so long as we draw breath."

Kruuti communicates gratitude that he answered at all, and shares the vision of his people and who they were at war with. Yes, the Reed People of the golden domes have long been our ancestral foes. But today I will claim what is rightfully mine. But today I will claim revenge in victorious battle that which is rightfully mine against Actun Degrange. You are too late. It is inevitable. Those that breath only air will pick the flesh from our bones in days. Whether they fly or climb the walls around us. If we don't get revenge against them now, we'll die forever having never found it."

We decide to wait and look out. The first group arrives in canoes and checks their armaments. There are 7 of them, armed with laser pistols and machetes. Flashlights are distributed, and they begin looking for a way up the crevice of the dam. They're not walking with their weapons out, and are wearing normal casual clothing. They pick their way through the scattered rocks, guiding each other up the interior crevice of the dam.

They talk about getting the jars (overseers)

The second craft arrives, delayed. Rahim steps away from the tent to get a better look. All of the amphibians have marched away to the back of the dam. This looks like another group of Carromir villagers, except we recognize some voices. Among them, we recognize the voice of Theodore Brosen. He also sees a few people dressed in what look like pale white robes with a device on their front like the iconography of the tipped over church. They get out of their makeshift watercraft - a skiff and canoe - 7 strong. They huddle much closer. They're trying to be quiet, and huddle together. The two robed figures pull out what looks like a Nalgene bottle, and pour in liquid from another vessel. They then take out a stick of gum or some such into the vessel. Within about 10 seconds, the Nalgene is glowing with light blue light, stronger than the flashlights from earlier. They use them as light sources, carefully picking their way forward. They begin to make their way up towards the entrance and the first group. They're armed with table legs and staves.

This is when we hear a gut-churning, loud metallic BANG. It wakes us all up...
