We go shopping for art. The art is incredibly special due to psychic involvement. something something something. As we're shopping, we get a delivery from a Derendali paramilitary org. Popping the seal shows a self-contained, bulletproof dataslab. Opening up connects it to the city network and runs through data security protocols. Our compads click (abnormal) and shut off. There's a booting noise and Herendor's face fills the screen. He's in an office of some kind - wood paneled, softly lit, leather, etc. An IV bag behind him is plugged into his neck. The work we did for him worked out really well. The IV is a lionization treatment - longevity in a bag. He's in deep with the coven (in a good way). Protip: don't go back to Site_002. We're allowed to say no, but he has a job for us. When he gets as high up as he is, you have a lot of people you can rely on. We don't need to be concerned about Shenkor Mohejen.

Have we ever been to Eurypides? Buy a jacket. Up until the last year, Euripides was run by two major factions: Miner Liberation Pact, formed in the wake of the Terran Mandate. What are they gonna do? Got a nuke. Glassed the entire planet, survived under the surface. Black-body tortoise, size of gravcar and can bite through a ship's hull. Don't forget your tortoise fence. About a year ago, there were two major deals. MLP controlled the whole place until the Eulius Crime Syndicate moved in. Kept producing Sumerium. They have a pre-tech food printer. The most expensive canolis.

Medias Faustus Eulius, head of the family at 70. 7-8 months ago, something knocked over the power grid on Euripides. Involved the Eulius family, and the entire command structure of the MLP collapsed overnight. ECS take over, keep mining open, close the port. Change uniforms or find a fast ship out of here. Starport opened, shuffle of personell, and now they're shipping sumerium in and out and have a lead on food production with pre-tech blueprints.

Eulius family has a lot of enemies. Invested parties want to see him stay where he is, but someone has declared war on him. We need to go play mafioso. If we want to do a favor for him, he wants us to show up, get involved, figure out what's going on, find out the most credible threat, and eliminate them. They think there's a proper hit coming on Eulius in the coming weeks/months. We should care because if we can make this work for him, he has about a truckload of pretech stem units.

We sign on to the job and are told to go talk to Sonita Achari, his art gal. We get a 70% discount, purchasing 10k art units at 3k. We store the GN onworld and opt to get half the tonnage in hovercycles.

We set up some holdings on Derendal, Rahim gets some cyberware and drones, and we set off for Hartoum and then Liang's Triumph. Notably, there are two ships waiting for us. One is a Derendali science vessel. The other is a general purpose system vessels out of the Hartoum orbital. While the Derendali ship isn't broadcasting on open channels, the system one is saying it's on a religious mission seeking additional colonial seeds and resettlement.

We make our way over to Liang's Triumph to find a society sealed in bubbles. The settlements are in calderas of extinct volcanoes, etc. Total population approx 650k.
