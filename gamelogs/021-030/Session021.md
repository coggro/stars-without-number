We try to sell some stuff.

Lots are usually min 1 metric ton, military goods.
Expertise score: Highest Admin/Connect of all of us + Highest INT/CHA mod. Trade capacity. -1 if we have no familiarity. Friction, usually between 2-5.

We roll 3d6, and get a deal for 40% of normal sale price. Normally, base cost is 10,000c/ton. We're looking at 4,000.

The mercs say we're crazy, but they'd work with us again. We get back the field radio, exchange comm codes, and part ways.

The trip back is largely uneventful. We squeeze in and ride out the day and a half in steerage. We're met by screening ships and pass through, landing on the surface. Vonketosen's house has been completely removed and replaced with a dog park. It's popular! The only lead we have remaining is the company that sent the spam email, tracing back to a strip mall within 2h ride by gravcar. It takes us 6 on public transit because we're poor. It's a soulcrushing strip mall in the middle of nowhere. The address looks like a skeezy rent-an-office in a strip mall. Inside, the entire place has the layout of a converted Radio Shack done up with tressle style tables. Lots of sad people sit in open office configuration, typing away doing direct outreach advertising. Nearly every one of them has an ankle monitor. Second from the back is Herendor Vonketosen, attempting to sell Health Powder to someone who doesn't seem particularly interesting.

Nobody stops us as we walk in. The aging carpet and drop ceiling look equally water-stained. As we approach, Vonketosen triple-takes. He takes his headset off. Appearing like a wraith from a door is what looks like the manager of the place who looks like he's peaked in life here. We give him a USB stick that he has to tab into a separate, unauthorized console. He starts watching the videos. The manager comes over and tries to tell him to get back to work. He looks at us.

He reaches down, unclips the ankle monitor, and hands it to the manager. He picks the monitor up and smashes his console with it. The manager is screaming, and he shotputs his smoking console through the plate glass front window. We rejoin Herendor on the sidewalk. He has a brief and quiet conversation on Emrite's phone. He thanks us for finishing the job. He asks us about the videos. Before he called us, he had a bunch of bets on whether or not we'd find what he thought was there. We get him a prepaid compad. He starts it up and taps in a text message. First, he punches something in to his compad. The manager behind us pulls his out, and starts walking over to us. He asks if it's true, and Herendor informs him that he is, in fact, fired. He does three flick motions towards us and each of ours light up. We each received 2MM credits each.

A care lands and takes us for dinner. He says we have literally saved his life, he owes us everything, and hopes a fat pile of credits is enough to pay some of that. He has no hotel recommendations, but if we stay at a good one, he'll buy it. He gets into the car, picks up a slice of pizza that was in there for him, and thoughtfully eats it as it takes off.

We get picked up and taken to a super-luxe, 5-star resort. We're greeted at the door, there is no one there but hotel staff, and we're escorted with hot towels, flutes of champagne, and sushi hats. O.O We're escorted to a fine suite with separate apartments for each of us in the seat of the Derendal empire. Anything we think we could want is ours to have. It will cost us 1500c/person/night.
