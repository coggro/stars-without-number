## 2020-10-24-S -- Session 022 #S022

We discuss trade routes and rules and such for a while before purchasing 20T of housewares (bates) and heading to Hartoum to sell them. Arriving, we encounter the mercs who want 3000/mth to be crew. We decide to try and offload the cargo first and see how it goes.

Emrite decides to go to Dovake Biso, the Shrine Priestess, who she helped place into her position. She goes on to tell us that she's upset with Priestess Sang. Derendal isn't thrilled at her installation. Sang is blackmailing her. She can make sure that taxes and tithes are ignored for our trade if we help her with Sang. She's on her way to another portion of the orbital and is likely carrying her blackmail material with her. She's trying to solve it for herself, but if we could help, that'd be great. We need to wipe her slab.

We secure a deal for our bates and go to buy some luxury pets, and then decide to try and make the smoothing deal work.
