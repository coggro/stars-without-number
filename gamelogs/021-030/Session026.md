## 2020-11-28-S -- Session 026 #S026

We go at it for 3-4 days, sending Hugo and Emmet around and such, trying to find our in. We're mostly in the starport and the first layer of the city. It occurs to us that we might want to stay close to our ship just in case we get caught in some shit. Each of us has seen stuff like scaffolding collapsing, buildings on fire, etc. It's a constant riot.

Kruti, who did a thing with Hutton in her background... Hugo and Emmet come back and report back that someone's asking for Kruti, flashing her picture around. They went through a busboy to the cook to the owner to a pawn shop to a prostitute to a different prostitute - and the story keeps going. Anyone with data access is seeing the same grainy photo of Kruti and being asked if they've seen this person. They don't know how's got her number, but there are people looking for her. When they asked who to talk to, the busboy said he was told to look for someone named Rasait in the tent city.

Euripides is pretty cosmopolitan, and we've seen people from many walks of life - including tabaxi from Liang's Triumph. We head into the tent city with Kruti in the form of a sizeable man. We're able to pick out Rasait in the tents we're targeting. He looks quite new to covert operations. They're nursing a bottle of some strange, bubbling, brown brew. We send Emmet and Hugo to secure food and libations.

The kid, who is charitably approaching 20yo, looks quite new to this. He's wearing tight-wrapping, warm-fitting clothing. His outfit looks appropriate to the weather and location. He has a rebreather hanging around his neck. He has a fairly substantial knife with a power cell slot, so it's likely sufficiently technological. We haven't seen lots of weaponry around here.

The kid panics seeing Emrite's sheer rifle. He represents Marius Chapman, who Hugo tells us heads up the Knifetwisters, a Tent City gang. They're actively recruiting, in a power struggle. He wants to meet with us. It's only good for tonight, at The Grindstone. He sends us a ping to TGS so we can get there. It's a machine shop. He just said "tonight," but they're usually up pretty late. Midnight.

We head back to the ship and start searching for information on the Knifetwisters. Emrite tries to find information on the planetary net, and finds that they didn't name themselves. They're a neighborhood gang in Tent City, 1/3 most active groups. Not clear where they're getting their money, but sure do have a lot of it. Recruit loads of offworlders.

Other gangs: 40 Owls (least violent - pickpockets and sex work); Pimp Street Scuttlers (shipbreakers)

50,0000 up front
10% for 5 years
3% thereafter

We start to head back and 2 ATVs pull out into the alley ahead of us. They're reasonably lit by the floodlights. 5 guys get off of them. We slow down, and 2 pull in behind us with 4 passengers. The ones in front have headlights pointed out at us. One walks out of the glare, putting our numbers potentially up to 10. He's a small guy with a glint coming off of his bare head. As he walks forward, he's limping a bit. He has a functional (but not well-maintained) prostetic leg, starting just above the knee joint. He has a large thermal knife tucked into an easy-access sheath on his chest - a sign of a merc/operator. He says, "Hello. I see you managed to escape the KTs unharmed. Glad to see it. We haven't met, but your reputation preceeds you. My name is Ipksch, and I'm here to convey a message. A polite one, nonetheless. Forgive the drama of my appearance. Leave. Get back onto your ship. Fly out into the dark. Don't come back. Disavow your agreement and disappear. You won't be chased, bothered, and won't need to worry about me or anyone I know ever again. If you decide otherwise, and prosecute your interests, you'll be hanging frozen from gibbets in the morning." Saw our armaments, had a personal meeting with Chapman. Doesn't believe us re: sheer rifle. "Take your leave. Give us your word."

We find 37Dc of loose chips and each one has, around their necks, a small medallion 3d printed with terrible resolution of a simple circle with a stylized ship on it, cracked in half like a cartoon. Also, each one has a small advanced melee weapon.
