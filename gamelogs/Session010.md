## 2020-07-25-S -- Session 010

We make it into the room, torn open by the cataclysmic damage dealt to the dam. This was some kind of server room - racks mounted to the walls with smashed and waterlogged server banks. One door on the opposite side is a security door with electromagnetic locks, etc. It has been sheared clear off of the door frame and lies in a puddle of water. Beyond the doorway are a set of stairs towards a room of similar size.

The stairs descend into a room that is somehow still flooded. Kruuti happens to have glowbugs! The next room is 15x15, and the water is 3ft deep. A lot of debris is floating around, but also larger chunks that look like actual objects. In the center of the room, on a pedestal, is a model of the dam itself in cutaway, showing the inner workings.

We see in the model that we are in a secret area of the dam, walled off from the normal facility. We find a door built into the wall. Emrite telekinetically clears the room of water. In doing so, we find a number of objects that don't look like debris. There are six distinct objects - about the scale of an action figure or barbie doll. One looks like the underseer robot, and 5 other models. They're not posable. Their heads are polyhedra that match and are scaled to fit the sluice gates on the model. We position them in and push them into the gates on the model. They fit in perfectly, and have an extremely satisfying click. We hear the clunk of an EM lock disengaging. The door on the wall slides open., revealing a short flight of stairs leading down. The floor still has about 1/8th of an inch of water, and some trickles down the new staircase.

We hear the thrum of high-voltage electronics. As we look down, there is a soft glow as lights on the ceiling and walls illuminate. 6 sarcophagi are mounted to the wall and heavily braced, secured to the walls. Each one is an argon preservation crypt, but the front face on each one is unique and personalized. One has a large, tiki-like face; another is a photorealistic koi; another is a cloaked figure; another is an exposed, pirouetting nervous system; another is an offset solar orb radiating beams; etc. Worked into each unique faceprint is a bread window showing the lit interiour. They're all significantly larger than Haranana's, 2'x5'. Humanoid figures lie in each one. In the center of the room is some kind of robot or robotic figure. It's as baroque and unique as any of the crypts. It looks like a significant amount of server storage is on the back, armored with a crenelated military-style casing. There's a faint shimmer in the light that reminds us of high-end body armor, and is plated in it. The rest looks vaguely humanoid, crouching down and gripping its knees in such a way that it looks like a desk. It has been constructed to look simultaneously like a kneeling servant and the seat and desktop of a computer terminal. In its chest lies a dark screen. Finally, the back wall of the room (dam-forward) is a single panel of reinforced metal with a hole in the center - an aperture for a large key.

All of the engineers are here, and their names are holographically displayed on the windows into their cripts. They hold an electronic cube in their hands that is still lit and working, with a fiber-optic like going into the corner of their eyeball. To access them, we'd have to open the external latch. Upon approach, the computer creature opens its chest and it turns into a sit-down computer console. It is built sharply, but is ergonomically accessible. Its head lights up and it regards us, but doesn't speak. Emrite asks for a status update. It pauses, and then reads out a bunch of QR code-like writing that we've seen before. Rahim is able to confirm it's the same set of symbols found in the bible. Emrite remembers that she was able to feed Haranana's diary into her compad, and we work out a rough translation program.

The robot provides an extremely formal greeting, along with a description of a process and a warning. In part, it's precious information, don't distribute it; in another part, it's dangerous information, be careful with it.

We get it to the next page using gesture controls. It's another set of warnings about the importance of security and how right now, the reader is participating in the security process of this information. Lots of emphasis on respect for one's tools, and some kind of gloss between the identity of the worker and the personification of the tools they're using. At the end of the long and difficult-to-translate passage, it ends with a clear and specific description of the process it's meant to complete. At then end, we'd understand how to create our own turbine robot. It's described as a turbine construct, embodied creation, possessed of the creator's intelligence and functionally indestructible so long as it retains its power source.

We try to get Alnitak's current status verbally, but it doesn't work. We try to put it in on the keyboard, but they're apparently holographic representations, so Rahim takes a seat and starts to type into the console. The metal is extremely cold and unpleasant. It looms over him, extremely sharp and threatening.

STATUS REPORT ALNITAK
Screen clears, response is essentially syntax error.

ENGINEER LOCATIONS
Another syntax error.

HELP/MAN
Report on commands and information in this computer. Layers-deep guide on the specific thing it offers, along with extensive reporting on security measures taken to secure this information.

SECURITY PROTOCOLS
It is the security protocols, preventing theft, destruction, or dispersion of information it contains.

LOG OF ACTIONS TAKEN
We're the first action taken with authorized users in several hundred years.

It also implies that it's a single element of a larger security system.

Emrite plugs into a sarcophagus and finds that the inhabitant is biologically dead, dated within 30s of being interred in every case. However - metabolic, cardiac, and pulmonary functions ceased, but all continue to have uninterrupted brainwave functions. She tries to pull the data from the dataline from the sarcophagus. Applying a line shunt cracks the line, and Emrite enters to search it. The device is a quantum entanglement device, used for the creation of virtual intelligences.

Emrite asks: Who are you?, but gets no response. The cubes are powered on a geologic time scale.

We want to figure out where the underseers are, and NODE 008 is unable to help with anything that's not physically connected to this installation. An additional fact we do learn is that there's no information going into the VI core. That line is dead, suggesting they were pulled and uploaded.

Asking for location on SITE_2 gives us a single ideogram. The ideogram expresses that this is the most sensitive information on this system. Are you absolutely sure you want to bring this up? Y

It shows a topographical map. Several miles to the NW, it pings a location. It's at the bottom of a significant depression in the landscape. We figure out that it recognizes us as users, and requires physical access. It's either to be used as designed (in-person), or you are not authorized. We find out that we're able to turn off hazards for mainetenance, but must justify it in natural language.

We exit and head to the top of the opposite side of the dam and see miles off. We can see the hill with animals, Carromir, giant swamp cyprus, windmill, other villages, and far in the distance is the sideways church, etc. In the other direction, we can see much more.

There are 3 sets of lights heading towards Carromir, like lanterns. The smallest one is by the church, and the two others are by the dam and an hour away from the dam.

On the other side of the dam is a soundless vista that stinks like an airless tomb in the light of an unwanted sun. We look out across a vast wilderness of rainbow-colored weeds drooping from strange branching floors of the previously drenched land. Overhead, on the valley sides, there are rich bandings of many-shaded stone. The walls of this valley, even then covered in water until weeks ago, gleam very strangely. The sides have snatches of mirror-bright sections, like a shattered disco ball. The floor looks nothing like the valley floor we came from; it's a blue-grey mud. In the silence is worming movement. Things are shifting in the distance, miles away. It's awkward to view, like a sheet pulled off a naked corpse. At the far end of the valley is the steaming thing, an enormous wound in the earth - a pit through which a tremendous pillar of steam is pouring off.

The movement is happening all over the dam. Emerging from the pool of water are strange, pale, amphibian-like creatures. Smaller than people. One, slightly larger and bedecked in a headdress or cloak, waves a length of wood or metal and gesturing at the trees, further to the west. Maybe 100 of them emerging from the pool. Carved in the rock on all sides are 100s or 1000s of carved curves, reflecting the sunlight in strange and interesting ways. They're all essentially similar. The rock has been cut and polished or have had smooth ceramic walls polished to a sheen. In front of many of them is a pit or hole, and inside are waterlogged flood lights in the same sort of style as the dam we're currently in. Every one of them faces towards and focuses on the pit where the steam is emerging. There appears to be a footpath from the dam to the pit. A series of bridges leading across the landscape that used to be underwater. The closest one is a white mound, then golden brown, then harsh matte black. Along the way is a small hamlet of golden houses. There's a hive along the way with some sort of activity, and then the steaming pit. The pit is surrounded by 8 tall towers(?) like prisons have towers on the edges of the walls. Mounds of dead fish form new geography with piles of their bodies scattered around the floor.

\*\*\* Is it built out of the same black "rock" the overseer was hurling? Y

**_ Fuckin' Sidebars _**

Telekinesis through a microscope: If it fxs solely on perception, neat. But if now, how difficult would it be to hone that skill to that level? Makes me think of Invincible exercising his flight in the comics to prepare for fighting the other viltrumites.

How much of our brains do we share?
