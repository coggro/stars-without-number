## 2020-05-23-S -- Session 002

We are in the smoking crater of the ship's boat. Something terrible happened on our way down, and so we have awakened several days after the crash. It's roughly 4AM.

"The crash has really thrown a wrench in your plans."

We stand on the lip of the crater. Emrite uses the light on her metatool to look at the area around us and notices that the ground around us is incredibly muddy. That's odd, since we're at the top of a hill... The trees around us look odd as well. Those near us have mud splashed on them up around mid-thigh height. There is something splashing in a nearby mud puddle.

Kruti takes out her light as well and we see a mostly-translucent speckled 6-tentacled cephalopod. Nearby, another also splashes in the puddle. It's a muggy bog. We're a good 75 ft above the plains below us.

We see lots of broken trees, but they aren't pointed towards the crater. Kruti attempts to fix the bioscanner and accomplishes her task in about an hour. Rahim figures out that the cockpit isn't disintegrated on impact, and landed belly-first. There may be salvagable data or systems in that cockpit. He also knows that he doesn't know much about the squids, but he's fairly certain they don't belong here.

Emrite searches the perimeter, armed with her shear rifle and laser pistol. She finds the burning trail of stuff behind the ship. She makes her way down the hill and gets the sense that there is considerable water here, flowing back to the NW - in the direction the shuttle crashed down from. She's about 3/4 of the way around when she finds the body of a sheep... in a large tree... 18ft off the ground...speared on a broken branch...

It's been dead for a while - smelt before seen, and the tree is spattered at least that far in black mud. The sheep is outside the splash range of the ship's crash, and has been dead for longer than 4 days.

Rahim makes his way to the cockpit. There's no body inside. Blood everywhere, but not bodies. There are holes in the flight console like someone shot it with a very powerful weapon. There is intact equipment, and Rahim is able to access the shuttle's computer.

- Last known location

  - Rahim assists via INT Pilot
  - Kruti figures out the ship went down just 26 km NW of the colony

- External force or mechanical failure

  - The shuttle had a series of catastrophic failures in sequence.
  - 10m before atmo, atmo sealant failure, atmo vented hard. To keep the cabin alive, the pilots executed a hard dive into atmo, which would shred the outside of the shuttle but keep passengers oxygenated. Shuttle hull badly damaged.
  - Just after atmo, pilot lifesigns flatlined. Severe damage to instrumentation.
  - After atmo was completed, 1 escape pod jettisoned (15 person capacity, 3 people inside). No other pods jettisoned before impact.

We realize that there have been no bodies left.

We expect full sunrise at 7am. We realize that the bog level is high, and that this isn't normal. Something has gone terribly wrong with this landscape. There are additional drowned sheep in the trees, and the trees are awash with black mud. Rivulets of water run everywhere. It's clear that there was a terrible flood here.

We decide to take some time and resources (spare parts, shuttle seats, escape pod engines, etc.) to create a crude hovercraft. We salvage enough energy in a B-cell to power the craft for 4 days. We board the Gender Neutral and Rahim takes the pilot's seat.

On our maiden voyage, the craft works! It stayes together, rattles a bunch, and is propelled by maneuvering pods from the escape pod. It makes a noise like a steam train in a tunnel, and rattles so hard it feels like one might chip a tooth. At some point, we hear a clang and a splash, and none of us can figure out what fell off...

The sun is high, we are all hot, and catching bugs in our teeth. Our passing is a vulgar affront to a fairly quiet scene as we realize that a recent flood has devestated the highlands. Whatever trees are still rooted are centers of debris islands - fallen trees, dead livestock, etc.

The craft works better on the water, but we begin to smell rot. We pass a pale, naked, human body - and then more. Scavenging birds circle overhead, scattered by the sound of our craft. Faces turn towards us as we approach where Carromir used to be. People are wading through the water up to their waists, chests. They're naked or half-naked, some in nightclothes... There's a river here that has broken its banks. Fish and strange squid everywhere. Birds love the squid, so they're not rotting in too many places.

We hear a bell ring out ahead of us and see houses piled together. We think we arrived at Carromir. As we're approaching, the water pushes us downstream atop a river heading through the middle of the settlement. A tree suddenly rises up like we had stepped on a rake. Rahim cranks the wheel. An engine bottle rockets away. We jerk away from the tree, clipping the ass of the craft, but avoid smashing full-on into the tree. We are intact, but rattled. We have arrived at what remains of Carromir.

Everything is stained with mold and lichen. People all over shout, wail, and haul makeshift skiffs of their things. People are barely getting their shit together from the catastrophic flood. Nearest us, an old man drags a drowned body onto makeshift docs cobbled together from broken beams. To our right, a priest from the pilgrimage site clings to a log, shrieking "Everything is ruined, oh god..." etc. etc. and seems to have run out of reasons to get out of the water. A woman rafting atop a large door is trying to keep several people atop her craft.

We're still far out from the buildings - 5-10 minutes - and haven't found dry land yet. Almost all water is knee-waist deep, and the center of the river is tree deep.

Life here is a complete mess.

Several miles NE of Carromir is a visible column of steam. The river continues on, but the people are devastated. There isn't much we can do for them, so we continue along.

Closer to the building are more people. Two women on a low hillock. One is screaming, audible over the roar of our apocalypse boat, often repeating "UNCLEAN MEAT". Next to her, paying apparently no attention, is an ancient crone of a woman with a corpse next to her, grabbing it by the head, and staring intently into its mouth. We pass them by as well. The screaming woman sees us, points at our craft, and continues to scream about "UNCLEAN MEAT".

We pass the remains of a building on a muddy hill, barely sticking out of the water. A man, almost as old as the crone, stands - dressed well, soaked to the bone. He is using his bare hands to scrape out shallow graves for bodies laid over the hill. Next to him, in a half-wrecked buidling, is a woman in her mid-20s, surrounded by a screaming group of 7-9yo children. They're all shouting at her, asking her where their parents are. She's frantically trying to calm them, and looks at our craft with an uninterpretable glance.

We decide to stop and have a chat with the schoolmarm. 2/4 walls were ripped away, and the building is half-collapsed. She wears a soaked dress, shivering. The children are also soaked, spattered in mud. Kruti bioscans the teacher and finds she's in relative good health - hungry, cold, but not poisoned or dying.

Emrite asks what happened, and the woman says there was a flood. The dam burst, the water came and washed away the town. She wants to know if we have any food, and that the children are starving. Kruti asks when this happened, and it has apparently been 6-7 days. Emrite asks about the dam. She points vaguely upriver, but doesn't know anything about the dam. She asks if we're there to help, and Emrite responds no. The woman looks crestfallen. She asks if we can take them to safety, but we can't.

She seems lost in her own thoughts, and the children begin screaming again. **Miss Trowen** begins sobbing as the children overwhelm her again. We push off and head upriver towards the dam.

Along the way, about halfway towards the cluster of buildings, a large mound of freshly turned soil with pale limbs sticking out of it, moves and twitches. Near the pile is a tall, thin man, down on one knee, with his arm around a small child, talking to him conspiratorily. On the other side is the biggest group of people we've seen so far, hauling on beams of wood out of a stack. We see one teetering towards the top, and attempt to warn them. When that doesn't work, Emrite tries to hit it with her shear rifle in burst mode. The shear rifle makes absolutely no noise except for an external mechanism marking off three rounds from the battery. The structural beam just... falls apart.

We begin to enter the cluster of buildings, a rural village center. Higher buildings have planks across rooves or floors for traversal. People are taking notice of our roaring devastation vessel. Buildings are wood, painted to look like stone.

We see a guy with a messenger bag with multiple compads and dataslabs on the roof of a building, looking out with binoculars at the column of steam. There is a virutally naked, raggedly thin child creeping up behind him, and he looks completely unsuspecting. Meanwhile, a large crowd is gathered between two connected buildings with a muddy courtyard between them. They're shouting in anger at one man wearing spacers' overalls, and they appear to be about to actually lynch him.

Rahim tries to warn the guy, but ends up accidentally distracting him. The kid takes advantage of the opening and takes a compad from his bag.

A moment of listening to the people are accusing the man of being a thief, that he stole bread, etc. We disembark and approach the crowd from the rear.

In the mud at their feet is a messenger bag spilling out the same kind of preserved meals we had from our ship. It's been stepped on several times, and has 60/man/days of high-density food. The stencil on them says "The Latipan". Kruti picks up the bag, takes 6 units out, and makes her way to the front of the crowd. Emrite uses her telekinetic abilities to mitigate the noose temporarily. Kruti begins passing out food and tries to disperse the crowd.

The crowd quickly dies down until the last ones remaining are the prime lynch executors. A shock of realization comes over them, and they release the man. They look at Kruti. One asks where the food came from, and she responds that they were in such a hurry to kill him they stepped over their own food.

The name on his coverall is Kashusko, Max. Tattoos crawl up out of his coverall from his neck to behind his ear. They are floral themed, and they cover most of his body. He shakily gets to his feet, thanks Kruti, and takes some time to catch his breath. She distributes the remaining food, and they disperse. Towards the end, the woman who had had the noose in her hand, takes her food and apologizes to Max, but seems to think he would get it. He smiles, and says he gets it, "but maybe not twice, alright?"

Kruti bioscans him, and he seems generally bruised and sore, but will be ok. He says the whole place went insane about a week ago. A wall of water swept through. They were doing a medical dropoff. Blast from upriver. He heard it go off. Nobody fights onworld normally. It's usually a safe run. They go to take cover, and he sees the wall of water. Slammed into the town like a fist. Their ship got tumbled, and they'll be here months. The food gets scarce and they're treating each other miserably. This bag of food was sold by one of the idiot deckhands. Captain sent him to recover it, and they flipped shit saying he stole it from them. He'll vouch for us to his captain.

He says the people who live her are weird - and he chooses to live in space. These people choose to live 2000 years in the past. Emrite tells him we crash landed and he seems astonished. Apparently, they saw us come down like a comet. He says Captain Zarathusa is a sharp man, fair, but be polite. He's at the end of his rope right now between the people and the deckhand, shit's nuts.

We take him on our hovercraft over to the ship that has rolled into the center of town on a 30deg cant and a 45deg angle, wedged between two buildings. Where the wings were torn, the space between has been crudely filled in with expanding foam. Ladders hang for access and tarps hang for sun shields. Workmen shout and locals mill about shouting at people in the ship.
