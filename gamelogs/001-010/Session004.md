## 2020-06-13-S -- Session 004

We've found a place to camp and plan out our evening. The night passes coldly. The scholars demand a spot in the tent, but otherwise keep the peace for the evening. There's a low-lying fog as we wake to the river still overflowing its banks. We pack out, unhook the Gender Neutral, and continue on. Emrite spent the evening with one of the devices, but didn't uncover any additional functionality.

We continue on and see a church, rotated 90 degrees onto its side - the steeple is a broken crystal lense. The sides of the church seem whole, but the door is 10 ft up and closed. The bottom has enough stacked against it that we couldn't make our own entrance immediately.

It is surrounded by giant toads (roughly 20, about the size of obese men) that have obviously feasted on corpses, to the point where several have exploded and died from ridiculous overeating.

We then see two children huddled on a large metal casket coming down the river. Rahim pilots the Gender Neutral to move them over to the shore. As we lay them out and begin to tend to their health, Kruti and Emrite realize that they bear a major familial resemblence to the guy Emrite saved from the falling beam with the shear rifle.

We turn our attention to the box, which is caked with mud and detritis. We clear away the dirt and find ourselves looking at someone's face. We've exposed a porthole on the broad face of the box and are looking through the window at a very old face - hairless and wrinkled. He's not rotted or obviously dead, but isn't moving and seems sleeping or unresponsive. He's wearing a hospital gown or other simple garment. We find what look like elaborate, stenciled markings on the side. It's definitely metal, and has connections ports for some kinds of cables or gas nozzles or something. Between Rahim and Kruti, we figure out it's a long-term life support or stasis pod. Gas nozzles suggest gaseous medium. If he's dead, he's perfectly preserved. It's not breached or corroded. Emrite hooks up to it with her dataslab and figures out it's a suspension pod, and was last updated 550 years ago. This is Terran Mandate tech. The readout says:

### Sarcophagus-Class Argon Suspension Crypt

### Occupant: Client, "Haranana, Ambato"

The anthropologists are so engrossed in their current argument with each other that they haven't even noticed we stopped, let alone the children or the suspension pod. When asked, they won't admit that they don't know anything about this guy, but insist that the other doesn't know anything, either.

Emrite finds a file system in the sarcophagus containing a journal and last will and testament for the client - encrypted and password-proteceed. She takes some time to plan out a hack to access them - failing at first, but succeeding immediately after.

His will is written entirely conditionally ("If I were to die..."). The journal is more interesting. He was a maintainer on the dam, I think? It concerns funding and beaurocracy, overseen by admin AIs that tried to smooth funding over decades at a time. As funding for the project got more and more erratic, they had to go into suspended animation between supply drops - 4-5 times. By the 4th time it happens, they're no longer very concerned about sleeping away the next several decades. He's like 700 years old by a real-time calendar. The last time, they figured automation would maintain the dam via worker-robots cloned off their brain states such that they would continue to work while they were in animation and update them when they woke up to a new supply drop. The dam exploded, though, and is unlikely to have occured due to failure of the worker robots, etc.

Through context, she manages to get the names of the other overseers. The anthropologists have never heard of any of them, but the naming conventions match up with the Reed People - local historical people. A final piece of information - there is a power source embedded in the suspension crypt - a miniature fusion plant that could power the Latipan.

We decide to make a run back to the town, preferably after exploring the church past the toads. Kruti hucks a chunk of driftwood. The toad doesn't hop away, but doesn't seem inclined to move very much.

Kruti consults her precognitive abilities to see if it's a good idea to go through the toads. The vision shows her hanging from the door of the church by herself, above a host of corpse frogs clamoring for her. We decide to try and hit a frog from the hovercraft, and Emrite fires with her laser pistol. She misses, but the toad turns to face us before deeply croaking and beginning to shuffle towards us. It pulls aggro from 4-5 additional toads.

Rahim shoots at a toad and connects. The toad bellows and speeds up, but they're unlikely to reach us any time soon. Kruti also takes a pistol shot and hits, but it's not enough to kill it. Emrite fires her shear rifle and the toad _unravels_.

She's able to distract the rest of the toads by strategically dismantling a few additional toads, and Rahim drives them up to the church to enter. Emrite fires two additional shots into the floor to create an entrance, and she and Kruti make their way in. They cut a few pipes and conduits, but are able to enter. The pews have all fallen to the floor (previously a wall). The altar is still intact, and appears to be a smaller version of a jeweler's loupe or detective's magnifying glass as the central focus in the room. The lens was massive enough that it bent the stem when the building tipped. A cabinet door hangs open at the front of the altar. There doesn't appear to be anybody else in the church.

They slide down and walk across the mound of wooden pews to the front. The whole place smells like old river water. Inside the altar, they see what was a well-organized series of baskets that have tumbled into one another. It looks like dried dumpling wrappers in the shape of a stick of gum (like communion wafers). An assortment of unbroken vials of clear liquid. The way the light refracts through the liquid immediately shows that it's clear, but not water. In addition, a thick book with brass endcaps and bound in leather. The cover also looks like the lens on the stem. It's about the size of a modern bible. The symbols are ideograms in the pattern and style of the hexogram qr codes on the sarcophagus. There's an 8x20 grid of them on each page, and was handwritten. Each of the vials is capped in a screw top. Kruti takes two vials of the liquid and two of the wafers.

Rahim sees that the toads are fully busy eating the other toads, actively getting in the way of their own progress. They check out a closet and find a cassock with a lens on a stem embroidered into it. Kruti takes a picture of the lens on the altar and the cassock.

We load back up and recover our materials and decide to head back to town with the spoils of our recent adventures.
