## 2020-07-18-S -- Session 009

We hired 2 people at 30 (3rd-level or so). They'll go to the dam but not inside, and will be paid half before and half after to guard the GN roughly 2-4 days. We get Douglas and Emma Harris, a married couple. Emrite asks a barrage of questions, which Douglas reluctantly answers.

Emrite tries to access the zombie device, and finds that the code was definitely written by another machine - it's written with no regard for human readability or maintenance. The battery inside is just enough to coherently animate limbs and conduct electrical signals through nerves - only animating limbs, not internal organs or anything. A final code module takes audio input, but not output.

The device is beginning to break apart, like amateurish or very cheaply made hardware. The onboard-memory for the device is extremely small.

We're able to climb up to the lowest room, which looks like a modern-day hospital room. There is another room on the other side that we couldn't see from the ground. We're rougly 1/4 of the way up, and this is roughly 90% up. The room we're in now is post-/pre-tech, more advanced than the 21st-century-limited colony.

We see enterprise shelving, stairs up, and a gap with serial ports with cables ripped free. It looks like where the sarcophagus may have been. A portrait above it appears to survive. The doors to the stairs up are bowed out from this side, suggesting water impact from in here. A space above those doors show stainless steel spikes dropped from the ceiling. No socket in the floors are there to accept them, and they're bent towards the stairs. They look deliberately sharpened.

The painting is a modern painting, placed on the wall with a covering. A few droplets of water have collected on the opposite side, suggesting it's not a perfect seal -- just a dust cover. The painting isn't a style seen in the past, but is meant to mimic things like egyptian heiroglyphs - the depiction of pharoahs and such. Not exactly - an homage. A crowned figure held a branching key and an iron sword. They chop off the heads of pale, starved people, who are crawling towards him offering heaps of gold ingots.

King with key hand burns alive race with dark skin and white hair.

King bathed in sunlight releasing water, drowning figures doing field work or manual labor, covered in darkness.

While holding relics discovered with Haranana, the figure looks archtypal, and difficult to pin to a single person. The peoples look subjugates as fuck. They don't look like the figures frozen on the log. We snap a photo with our dataslabs.

The flashlights on our suits show something glimmering in the room beyond the doors, and a sound like a servo or mechanism chugging. Emrite moves forward to see what's happening. She sees another argon crypt with a badly rotted corpse hanging halfway out. There's an armature holding the crypt, able to support the full weight. In the corner, badly smashed up, is a
group of robot dogs. One leg is repeatedly trying to walk, while the rest of it slowly dies... D:

Emrite tells us what she saw and that it's safe to come up, and we do. She wants to hack the sarcophagus and dog to gather information and figure things out. With more light, we see that there are more oil paintings on the walls in here. There's also another door. It looks virtually identical to the previous door, but with no deployed spikes. It doesn't look like it's been bowed in and breached.

The painting is of the same king. The crown is done in the same pigment as the fire from the previous painting, a yellowish-white. Here, he gives charity - stacks of gold and grain to stacks of people. He's surrounded by what looks like admirers and standing in front of ranks of troops with rifles and dog-drones at their feet.

Emrite tries to hack the sarcophagus first. This crypt is much smaller than the others, with significant conduit going into the structure of the dam itself. The sarcophagus says that this is the body of Embato Haranana... :O It says that he has died from an unplanned sealant breach. Catastrophic seal breach around when the place was bombed. The interment date matches the other sarcophagus. The bioscanner assumed room temperature around the time of the dam's damage. However, the warning light says that we're not scanning a person. Emrite uses her telekinesis to crack into it, and there's no skeleton or organs. After thorough scanning, this thing is made of biotissue on the outside with a cartilaginous structure inside. It's meat and biological, but no way it was ever alive.

She also hacks into a dog robot. They have railgun armitures attached to their backs. Kruti is able to take one off and store it for use on the GN, probably. Emrite tries to figure out what their purpose was, etc. They're very heavy and have a decent amount of armor. They're military drones. The files on them suggest that they're sentry drones in a charging cradle, since they have maintenence runtimes and were scanning their patrol area - this room. She checks to see if there's anything else in the sarcophagus, and there isn't. She tries to hack into the dam through the consoles, and gets:

Catastrophic damage sustained, lockdown protocol in effect, isolated circuits only

The sarcophagus has long-term preservation data, with logs back to the time it was interred. Vitals indicate normal life signs, all within the normal parameters. All suggests that this was an actual person. Emrite pushes the door open.

When the doors are opened, there is the crackling snap of the sudden discharge of a very high-voltage capacitor - followed repeatedly by the ping of metal spikes hitting the space immediately in front of the metal door. The space beyond is another stairway - similar to this room. This one goes to the ceiling with a trapdoor. The base is set flush with the floor above it. The doors are apparently capable of being secret. Hm.

Emrite floats a drone up into the next room. The walls are more or less plastered with warnings of danger of electromagnetic/ionizing radiation. Beyond this point, you risk severe energetic discharge damage. Threat to person, mental capacities, magnetic tapes, storage, and quantum entanglement personality cores. There are 8 humanoid robots in the room wearing what looks like significant armor plating. They're set into charging cradles, but the seams making up their component parts are leaking battery corrosion. The hatch is in the left-front side of the room. The room, however, is dry. Between the 4 on the left and 4 on the right is a heavy steel plate set into the floor at an angle.

Kruti has a vision of going up to pass through the room and it doesn't go well. We turn back and decide to head up through the crack in the dam to the room we saw from the first room we entered, and end here.
