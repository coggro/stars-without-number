## 2020--S -- Session 007

There's space for the three of us, one more person/gear comfortably, and a final person/gear uncomfortably. 7 forms emerge out of the water, and each one appears to have a glowing red light on the back of their necks. Emrite unleashes a burst of shear rifle fire, but fires high and hits the treeline. Rahim manages a tight spin with the Gender Neutral and spins off several of the creatures. He then draws his laser pistol. Kruuti attacks with her psychic saber, slicing one in half.

Two attack Emrite, who shoots one in the head and avoids the other. Rahim speeds through the group and puts some distance between the group and the zombies. Kruuti strikes at the remaining zombie and misses as we hit a rock. She strikes the GN, causing damage. The ship is now over half damage, and speed is halved. By the light of the sparking console, we can see that these are drowning victims, bloated and dead.

The clinger climbs aboard. Emrite moves to get a bit of breathing room. Rahim shoots the new arrival, and Kruuti kills both in a single strike of the badass saber.

We continue on our way back to Carromir as Kruuti and Emrite begin to look at the tech embedded in the zombies. They appear to be fractal PCBs, attached with fiberoptic filaments through to the brain and spine. As we're heading back past the sunken bridge, and almost immediately, something large starts rising out of the water. Like a dome, directly behind us. In the dark, it looks wider than the GN is long and regularly stippled on the top. The dome rises up and 6 multijointed limbs, wrap around the corpses, and jerk it all under the water. The dome then sinks back down under the water. We nope out of there and head back to the Latipan. We're able to repair overnight as others sleep, and crash for the night.

**DAY BREAK**

Things have improved significantly, and can purify and crack water. Lots of welding and such going on. We go to Captain Zarathusa with the zombie weave and information on the dam. We discuss the dam, the GN, the animals on the hill, and zombies. She's seen this tech before - colonial seed technology. It takes any silicates in the soil and uses whatever it can to build basic transponders. It looks like tech used to build something with no human interaction, like an evolutionary neural network. Looks like someone planted one in the back of someone's head. We're offered cash to bring back whoever's doing it.
