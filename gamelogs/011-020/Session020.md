## 2020-10-03-S -- Session 020 #S020

We discuss leaving, but realize that the other stalactite should probably be cleared as well. We decide to rest in the crate and wheel room. We eat and rest uneventfully.

We then head back down past the giant, decomposing differently than a human body, and go towards the bridge over to the other stalactite. We look across and see that there are no guardrails on the bridge. It's 30' wide, and significantly longer. Emrite floats a glowbug into the void to try and spot the observatory clamshell. It's closed, as we left it, down at the bottom of the stalactite.

We cross the bridge and Emrite rips open the door with telekinesis. On the other side is a medium-sized room, 50' deep, 30' across. There's an extremely tall, barely arched opening. There are two massive lengths of chain beyond. Between us and the opening, the room is filled with looming, empty shelves of disassembled modular boats. They may have once made up a yacht-sized craft. In some places, they look broken; in others, they look disassembled. Scattered among them are stables - horse-stable sized pens, but the corpses in them look like man-sized stag beetles. There's a curled up spider-like creature, and a centiped/millipede shell the size of a SEPTA bus. All of the shells we can see are dessicated and badly cracked. A ladder leads up.

Emrite floats in a glowbug to look in the room and shaft. The chains are identical to the chains above. Emrite crosses the room and looks down the shaft. It goes down for about the length of the bridge until the shaft ends into open air. It continues down further past the light.

We decide to go up the ladder into a room that is about the same side. It also features a portal into the chain shaft. This one looks like it has several easels in it, meant to hold significantly sized rectangles. They're pretty robust, but there is a significant amount of dried blood on the floor. A few chips of some tannish-orange stone (one smeared with a bit of pigment). The room is otherwise empty.

The blood is not human. The bioscanner says it's 130MM years old. It's dinonychus blood. There is no corpse, and no sound from above.

The room above is filled with roughly 100 stacked aluminum boxes, 4x3x2. A quick count gives us the figure of 80 boxes. Opening one reveals a masonry saw in rubberized seating. It's disk-shaped. It has a gas- or fluid-socket to power it. It's man-portable, but heavy duty construction equipment. Opening another shows a hand-cranked liquid pump. There's signs of heavy use on this - the smell of decay and coppery iron smell sits in the box with it. The smell comes from the internals. A third box contains a well-used and maintained jackhammer, with the bits in it. It has a similar smell and stains as the pump and socket connectors as the saw. The doorway to the north into the shaft has other open portals.

The room across the way look like plain calcite passages. However, a room across the way below our current level has what look like laser scorch marks on the walls.

We experiment a bit with telekinetic zip lines, and Rahim is the first to take it down to the laser-scorched corridor. It's definitely laser-scarred, and there is considerable dragged laser fire. Down below, there are stairs that very gently descend into a circular chamber within view. There is an industrial, utilitarian metal framework - the kind of thing used to hook up to an engine block to hang it to work on. There's something large in there to work on, roughly bolted into the calcite. This looks new, fresh. The kind of thing we might see out in the world. There's some kind of long, cigar-shaped complex object - all kinds of wires and pipes running off and secondary capcitors, and the focusing array of a very powerful laser. This is a modern, heavy-duty, weaponized laser. It's pointing at, pretty obviously, a sculpted altar looking like a spider with way too many legs on its back, curled up, dead. Encased within is diamond or ice, but it's uncertain which. It's optically clear, but the room is very cold. In the center of the mass is a humanoid figure. From where he is, he can see a crude, square-edged borehole going directly into the space where it is and not extending the other side. It has no head. However, the space where his head would be is bubbled out and has a smear of something black coating the bubble inside the block.

Everyone else arrives without incident. Emrite recognizes that this setup is an extravehicular mount for an antivehicle laser. This is usually mounted on a tank to kill other tanks. This is a heavy weapon that does 3d10 damage. This weapon is too large for a human to carry on their own. It's exclusively designed to be mounted on a vehicle. Emrite removes it from the frame and puts it in our cargo crate with Auscultation, IR lantern, and the orb of moving metal, monomolecular brass knucke/ulu knife, and monomolecular FUBAR with the ring, which have all definitely been in there the whole time.

In the back corner, behind the strange cold substance, is a ladder going up. Kruti bioscans the humanoid, finding that it has the same general layout as a human but returns as an unknown alien. It has no overlap with human DNA. It's also super dead. The cold substance is a carbon matrix - a kind of diamond. It's wildly thermally conductive, and can keep itself and whatever's touching it extremely cold. Emrite tries to lift it with telekinesis, cracking it and revealing some blood of some sort.

The room above has a large pile of dessicated wood shavings. It's more dust than wood remains. There's a ladder going up. We go up.

This room has rust stains on the calcite, but there are no boxes. It's cleaned out. There's no ladder leading out, but is an opening to the chain shaft and a room across.

We zipline down to the lower of two chambers visible. It's filled with the shattered remains of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of nautilus shells. From the size of a pea to a house. Buried among them are metal or wooden display frames, ladder leading up built into the wall.

Before we finish climbing the ladder, we smell salt and chlorine - no stronger than a public pool. There are other metallic odors. The rungs of the ladder at the top are caked in salt like the dead sea. Touching it doesn't hurt. The metal isn't injured by the salt, but it's covered in it. The bioscanner gives a low-level alert of a radiation source. We send a compad up.

The room is like many we've seen before, but like if someone took chaise lounges and fainting couches and sank them into the dead sea for a few years. It's all caked with up to 1.5ft with salt crystals. 3 humanoid figures are sprawled out across the room. They're exaggerated feminine forms are comprised entirely of metallic or mineral crystal. Each one has a gaping hole in the center of their chest, clean through to the other side. They're not moving. This room also has no back side. Across the room from the central chain shaft is an open balcony with no rim that looks out to the bridge. There's a ladder leaning up.

We proceed up. Kruti identifies the bodies themselves as the radiation sources. The bioscanner doesn't identify anything living. The assay scanner returns chlorine, sodium, and some uranium along with phosphorus. The bioscanner also beeps towards the ladder, setting off all lights and vibrating. It has detected no fewer than 6 human-lethal toxins in the direction of the ladder. Emrite telekinetically vacuum seals herself and we send a compad up again.

The above chamber is empty except a series of massively reinforced pressurized chambers. There's a single patch on one with several hard locks on it with twist wheels like steam boilers. There's a corpse on the floor beside this port. There is a very small coffee-saucer size glass viewhole into the chamber, and it's glowing bright green. The corpse is collapsed in a heap next to the wheels sealing the only door-like apparatus on this device. There are no other exits except that ladder and an opening into the chain shaft. We opt to avoid this room and instead climb up through the chain shaft.

The next room is widely empty, excpt it seems as though someone took a fire axe to a room full of dressmaker's dolls. We count around 3 figures with cloth skin made out of silk with screaming women's faces in photorealistic print. They also have laser scorches. In the middle of all of it is a bolt of what looks like silk with laser holes, while the fringe of the bolt of silk has skeletonized hands woven into the fabric with no thumbs. The room below looks like it's full of sample cabinets. Glyphs label each drawer. Translating one reads "Geologic Sample - Vampire Strata". Another reads, "Geologic Sample - Sword Strata". The merc are significantly freaked out.

We float a compad and bioscanner over to the poison room simultaneously and scan the body, which is in a spacer vacsuit. It's weeks-months since time of death. There's such a profusion of toxins in the body that it can't get more specific. This is like Ricin, Xyclon-B, crystalline arsenic, etc. They're so poisoned that it was enough to trigger emergency protocols from ~50 ft away. It's in fact suggesting we discard the scanner and quarantine. Kruti looks into the future to see what would happen if we recover them, and the result is horrible blood vomit. We abandon the bioscanner and compad.

We climb up to the room above the poison room. This one is full of smashed crates with ostentatiously large locks on the outside. They're crowbarred open, or cut with lasers and blowtorches. A few are simply untouched. A ladder leads up. The crates are unlabelled, but look similar. The room above it is really dusty. It looks like a plant nursery - long bedding tables full of dust and a floor thick with filthy dirt and broken glass. Overhead is some kind of shattered hemisphere dome mounted in the ceiling. It has something complicated and filiment inside. Shelves along the north wall have sealed glass jars with things inside them. The southern wall has a number of glass spheres that the bioscanner quietly informs us are also sources of radiation. At this distance, it looks like they contain flowers. Each sphere is the size of a fully inflated beach ball. No ladders lead out. An opening into the shaft reveals nothing across the way. In fact, there are no more openings in the shaft until we see the shaft disappear into an opening into the chamber above.

We go across and down. This is a weird room. It's bell-shaped, 4-5x as tall as the others but just as wide. A central spiral staircase wrapped in mesh has an entrance on the ground floor. Hanging down from the top of the chamber are a set of very very complex weighing scale. Two arms reach out and chains lead out to the floor with hooks through the weighing pans. At the top of the stairs is a significant amount of gearwork, dials, guages, wheels, etc. The stairs lead to these and beyond. There are shelves surrounding us and on every level of this room all the way up. The shelves look like there are very plain cylinders of various kinds of metal underneath bell jars with fine writing on the exterior of the outermost bell jar. There are thosands and thousands of them. They translate to "15 souls", "Innocence Year", "1 Hour of Sorrow", "1 Minute of Abject Terror", etc.

There are 5 landings on the stairs.

"1 Broken Promise"
"Unexpected Dry Rot, Experience"
"An Earthquake"
"Effective Propoganda"
"1 Year of Solitary Confinement"
"Am Emotionally Fatiguing Childhood"
"Unworthiness, Pervasive"
"Family Scandal (Major)"
"Religious Fantacism"
"Fraud"
"Being Attacked By Your Own Pet"

At the top of the stairs are all of the thousands of gears and levers, each one with a minutely inscribed labels. "Holiness", "Beauty", "Honestly", "Strangeness", etc. They're arranged in some kind of grid-like format.

We come out up top into the room with the very first iron wheel we found. we return to the first room and begin towards the undoored hallway. Kruti gets a vision of 6 statues animating to attack Hugo and Rahim.

Rahim fires off some lasers and retreats. Emrite destroys the three closest to Hugo immediately with telekinesis. The remaining ones approach, but don't have time to attack. Hugo and Emmet raise their guns and fire, blowing apart one of the remaining three. Kruti takes one down with spike thrower fire.

Rahim shoots at the approaching guy with his laser pistol. Emrite promptly destroys it.
