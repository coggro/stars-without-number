We do a bunch of trading and purchasing. We repair the GN, Rahim gets a laser rifle in exchange for two laser pistols and some credits, and some extra A Cells. Kruti and Emrite get grenades, some additional armaments, and tools. We also hired 3 mid-level mercenaries for 4 days work down on the planet for 240c. We book a ship for 5 days of travel and waiting for 500c.

Kruti goes to the library to find that the reed people are generic, nothing on several items otherwise.

We arrive on the ship to go down planet with our mercenaries, Hugo, Emmett, Cassius. We arrive an hour's walk NW of Site002. We head out and it takes the better part of 5h to travel to Site002.

It looks different now. Before, it was several towers around a pit and on a patch of bare ground. Now, there's a crowd of around 100-150 people standing in a loose crowd around the gate. They're randomly scattered around. More than half are comopletely naked, and those that are clothed are wearing a wide variety of Carromir daily wear. There's a constellation of red lights on the backs of their heads.

After a smidge of deliberation, Emrite tries to smash some like bots. It works and, 10 minutes later, they're destroyed. Emrite attempts to backtrace the zombifier through the zombie device. She's able to find any clones of this device, but finds none. It seems that none exist, no identical transponder IDs are operational nearby, or they're not nearby.

We walk through drifts of flood-bloated Carromiran corpses. We proceed down to the bottom of the pit and to the vault door. There is enough light focusing in to the pit through the towers and glittering lakebed, that it is brighter than anywhere else. There are visible, ragged wisps of steam rising from the door and sand. We can see what's just beyond the gate: the main body of the gate is constructed out of the same black, concrete-like stone as the dam with a similarly heavy metal door inside. Water streams down into the opening. Almost sharp-edged steps turn down in a spiral beyond the open gate. There are no obvious traps. The interior of the door is untouched by corrosion or corruption.

Emrite telekinetically floats a flashlight downwards into the gate to see what's there and see if anything responds. It provokes no reaction. We examine the door to find that there is an enormous, simple mechanism designed to resist basic force. There is no method of opening the door from the inside. There is a locking mechanism on the outside that is badly mangled - melted. There is a space for a key, but the metal itself is warped and slagged.

With Fix, Kruti tries to figure out how this happened. Her first thought is thermite, which might burn hot enough to go through it. While there's plenty of slag on the outside, it wasn't hot enough to melt this door. Thermite burns at over 4000degF without additional additives. Someone used it with additives and it essentially just cleaned a patch of the door, but something else has melted this. There aren't any scorch marks, suggesting molecular acid - so corrosive it would require superconductors to handle to prevent it from contacting even the flask it's kept in because it would corrode it.

The mercenaries rack the bolts on their combat rifles. We proceed down 2 abreast quite a way. We go deeper than the 100 meters that we initially found. As we go down, they hyperdense black material transitions into a white calcite stained every so often with other minerals. Then it abruptly turns to steel. We clear the mass surrounding us and it continues to descend into open air, contained by effectively chain link fencing. We end up in a wide, open room. It's like a slice taken from an upturned ziggurat, like the pit. 3 layers of 3m high incline. Each level of room has a room of naked humanoid calcite statues, looking down into the room like an audience.

The stairs lead out just off of the center of the room, next to the hole in the center of the room's floor. Looking down, we can see it drops another 10ft into another hallway. There's a passage that leads off to the side and two things at the top rank of the stairs: on the top right, an open passage leading away; on the top left, an archway made of shaped calcite pieces blocked entirely by heaped up coils of what appears to be an enormous metal serpent. The head is the dead center of the door, large as a curbside trash can.

It's dead silent. Can't hear the wind and rain above, with a gentle trickle of water. The whole room appears to have been cut from a single piece of luminous white calcite. Any light reflects back with an almost lunar glow. The design is fundamentally different from the design of the dam and such.

On the bottom floor looking to the right, it looks like a 10ft wide, 50ft passage bored into the stone. We head down this hallway, our footsteps echoing. The air pressure changes as we go into a huge room. The ceiling is 50-70ft above us. The room splits into two parts. It's a 200-ft hall, like a hangar. It's dominated on the far end of the room by a gigantic iron wheel stained with rust, 40ft across. It's mounted to the wall, and has a band made from an enormous creature connecting it to a smaller wheel that is, in turn, connected by a series of chains that would need to be pulled across an ornate pit in the center of the room in order to turn the wheel. However, despite the smaller chain attached to the huge band of hide wrapped around the giant wheel, there is a different chain hanging off the large iron wheel. The wheel itself is more like a cog, with each tooth fitting into a link of the chain. Shining lights on the chain, it shimmers and bleeds light. It's similar to the saber Kruti has at her hip. The room's function is strange. It looks like something of human scale attached to a larger wheel with a multicolor chain attached - it's odd.

Closer to us, in the floor, are three strange things. Two of them look like... burrows, maybe? Irregularly carved out tunnels. Large enough to fit a crawling person, like a manhole. One of them is on either side of a bronze-colored square panel that sits between them. The hand-scale chain lays across here. It looks like one would have to hold the chain and walk over the bronze door every time you wanted to rotate the wheel. There are smashed fragments of some transparent substance shattered across the floor here. The panel appears to be a door because there is a seam in it.

Emrite tries to rotate the wheel with her telekinesis. As she gets closer, she sees the stylized door has a mouth, teeth, and tongue. None of us recognize this style. Rotating the chain takes more effort than she expects. She pulls on the chain which pulls on the flywheel, which rotates the mechanism. Dust shakes off the band in great flakes. The giant iron wheel turns. As it does so, the massive links on the huge chain settle under their own weight. Metallic squeals and echos drift up from the dark like bird song. Most of which is coming from the pit under the wheel where the majority of the chain descends and hangs. Nothing else happens, though.

There is the trapdoor in the floor, two rough handworked holes that curve away, a giant hole in the floor at the far end where the larger chain descends, a stairway just beyond that carved into the floor.
