We return to the statue room and descend into the pit. The pit is a bit translucent, and the reflections are slightly odd. Kind of milky. Near the edge of the light about 50 ft further is a foot, attached to something messy and neither alive nor moving. We approach the lumpy, collapsed shape, sending a glowbug down the hallway as we get close. It's got at least 1 boot attached. At one point, it was a person. Now it looks like roadkill. With additional illumination from the glowbug, we see the wall to the right and ceiling are spongesmashed with blood and drying bits of gore. The floor has a small pool, and the left wall has absolutely nothing. It looks like someone was hit by a car on the TR side of this passageway. They're wearing what remains of a gilly suit. They have a satchel, partially crushed and torn. Underneath their body is a very large hunting crossbow - full length of their stout body.

Emrite retrieves the satchel and the surprisingly undamaged crossbow towards us. The crossbow is slim profiled with several counterpullies. As it gets closer, we can see several things. The satchel is dripping, but not blood. There is a strong chemical odor coming out from the satchel. Emrite turns it over in the air and catches the items as they come out.

WE FIND:
K - 1) Good Binoculars, with charged battery
Cassius - 2) Entrenching tool, can double as hand weapon with a hammer on the back. Made from titanium, with smears of local mud. Completely utilitarian and unadorned.
K - 3) Very small screen like a razer flip phone or compact. Similarly unadorned. 4) Wide variety of glass vials, all smashed, unlabled, previously full of chemical.
Hugo - 5) Electric lamp, bought off a shelf somewhere.
1/M - 6) 3 A cells
K - 7) 6 unbroken vials, like small test tubes. Built like heavy duty glass with a pressure seal and lock, with stuff floating in them.
(V1) Dirty lakewater, bioscanner alerts that it's extremely thick with necrotizing bacteria
(V2) puplish-blue slurry, bioscanner alerts thick with (probably) hallucinagenic mycotoxin equal with nematocysts like on a jellyfish or man-o-war
(V3) looks like orbitz drink, appears to be alive, and identifies them as parasitic eel eggs.
(V4) Completely clear, looks like water, bioscanner indicates that it is NOT WATER. Appears to be cactus extract, and a neurotoxin.
(V5) Clear, slightly metallic liquid, with metallic fishing line inside, spooled up and hanging in a loose bundle. No biological indication.
(V6) Like nothing we've seen in our lives. It reacts to light like ferrous liquids to magnets.
E - 8) Crossbow, profiled like a sniper rifle. It is a shockingly powerful crossbow. This cannot be bought. An extremely talented craftsman made this. We find 10 50-inch bolts for it, identical to the ones we found embedded in the GN. The materials to withstand the forces the crossbow generated would require technology equivalent to the sheer rifle.

It seems likely we found the motherfucker who hurt our baby. Emrite squeegees the blood and chemicals off to the side and we proceed. Kruti scanns the slurry and it comes up with a CVS receipt worth of alarms about how severely dangerous it is. Not just with the individual effects, but also combinatory effects. However, none of these are what the bioscanner says killed the person. It was loads of blunt force trauma, like having a safe or piano dropped on them. They died roughly 48 hours ago.

At the far end of the hall, at the limit of the light is a reflectivity. Kruti uses the new binoculars to look down the hall. The hallway appears to lead into another broader (30') chamber with a highly reflective construction. The chamber beyond is not regularly shaped.

We enter the next chamber and are in a nautiloid shell. It's polished to a reflective sheen. The polish and translucency makes it look like there are ghosts of ourselves watching us walk around the room. There is another chamber just beyond.

There are stairs that go out into a void with no containment, and we are able to hear the shifting chains of the upper room and see massive stalactites and stalagmites. 70deg down it extends down and finishes in a landing. There is also a particularly ornate bird-like cage split down the middle and removed from the bottom. This is mounted onto a long implement along with a small hand sits at the bottom of the stairs. It's sprawled out in a pool of what looks like dried blood, sticking out of the archway out of the structure.

We hammer in climbing anchors, rope ourselves together, and descend to check out the landing. Inside the archway, we find the body of a young and beautiful woman. She's lying on the ground, dead. She looks like she couldn't have been more than 20. She's clutching the strange scepter. It looks like a medical device, with a mass or technological bulk in the center. It looks like it's supposed to fit against some part of a body. It's clearly covered in some kind of power conduit. There is a lozenge-like module that runs up to the cage and a second lozenge inside the cage. It's meant to be pressed up against some part of the human body, but has enough cruelty to it that it doesn't seem meant for therapeudic use. The cause of death is fairly obvious: her torso is rotated 180 degrees to her legs. She also died roughly 48 hours ago. She's wearing mud-spattered hiking boots and weather-appropriate hiking pants, a durable rain shell, and a high fashion blouse. She has a profusion of rings on all her fingers and, lying nearby, a sizeable leather messenger bag. Emrite empties it.

WE FIND:

1. Profusion of used compads, some that look like cheap off the shelf whatever devices, some like extremely expensive high-end devices, and none look new. They're clearly well-used. None broken.
2. Large number of completely burnt out A cells - 6-7
3. Bundle of {POWERFUL OPIATE} peraphrenalia in clear, flexible plastic.
4. Tightly wrapped bundle of clothing, like a formal dress - haute couture

There's a human-sized arch that goes back into the structure. It goes straight back into the calcite column in the same way that the passage out went in. Down here there is a hallway that ends in a room with a hole in the floor and a large ladder, 2x as large as the last one. After that is a room as large as the trapdoor/wheel room upstairs, but is used primarily for storage with another wheel and cables going out and back into the ground.

Emrite opts to start turning on the compads and check them for data. As she does, we hear bootup noises from companies and models from 7-10 years ago. None of them are still functional like compads, but they still store data and are usable as computing devices. Most of their functionality is deliberately disabled, with the personal information of formal owners on them. None of them require any sort of login or authentication. They all have a bunch of correspondence on them, the personal messages of their owners. They all have academic titles. They were all professors, educators, or researchers. Their info indicates biopsionics specialties in various ways - biopsionics, biotech WRT psionics, psionics WRT biotech, etc. There are reunion letters, like one from a famous researcher thanking Zalushka Vonderlinth for her response, but there isn't much money in personal projection psionic research. The concepts being discussed are basically using metadimensional energy to be in two places simultaneously at once - possibly even corporeally. Whoever wrote the thing they declined, has written a sprawling treatise on the topic filled with both garbage and remarkable thought. Lots has been deleted. Another message is sending an article to an editor that has been approved from an academic research journal, with the first guy's name describing, in tremendous detail, displacement techniques. Zalushka isn't mentioned, and all the crap is cleaned out of it. The only other relevant information is some sort of classified research project - working titled "The Snakewood Device" - it's all encrypted and has not been broken open. It's hardcore military-grade encryption. Emrite saves the files to her slab and figures she'll deal with it later.

The stairs continue down roughly 200ft until they abruptly stop, and continue up roughly 200ft before meeting the ceiling.

We continue into the storage room and find the stack of Pelican-case-like storage containers. Emrite opens one up with her telekinesis. There's no decompression. Inside are small boxes, about the size of large matchboxes or a red brick, unlabled. There are several hundred of them. Emrite pulls one out and opens it up. It's full of what look like bullets, and she recognizes them as caseless ammunition. They glow very faintly with a light blue glow, alertiing us to an unshielded radiological source. It's unlikely to hurt us unless we straight-up ingested it daily for a week or something. Emrite recognizes them as radiological tracking rounds. The mercs whistle appreciatively.

The next crate contains 50 radiological smart weapons systems made to be fit onto combat rifles. We have the mercs outfit their rifles with the new systems.

Another crate contains 50 combat rifles in a fashion we've never seen before. They are unique styles of fully automatic battle rifles. The entire rifle looks like the're meant be held and used in a certain way by a specific shape of person. They just look like they were produced by something that was shaped by a person, but had never met one.

Another crate contains racks of combo brass knuckles and ulu knives. The edges have the same electric blue gleam of a monomolecular edge. It's a case of 100, wrapped for storage. They're made of a single piece of whatever was used to make them, which is black and metallic but not carbon fiber.

Another crate contains similar hand weapons, but have a single extruded haft meant to be carried as hand to hand weapons. These are also made of single pieces of the same material with monomolecular blades. At the bottom of each one is a ring mounted to the bottom of the shaft, about the same width as a can of soda.

Another crate, is much lighter than the others and lined with something unusual - a dull grey metal. This one is chased through with circuitry, and is pretty obviously psi-tech. Kruti examines the lining material with an assayer from the posttech toolkit and finds that it's a lead lining. The circuitry looks similar to the saber. She picks it up and learn that the shaft has a black on black relief carving which is a stamp of the QR code language. This one translates as a single word: auscultation. It matches the heartbeat of whoever the tip of the weapon is pointing at. Saying the word out loud gives an additional beat outside of the others. Thinking the word does the same thing. The bioscanner doesn't reveal anything new, but does reveal that nanoparticals are roughly 10x the expected level. She sets it back in the case and wheels it off to the side.

Another case has another single object inside with a significant amount of structural framework padding, and is a black ball inside a case about the size of an orange with key slots on either side of it. Bioscanner doesn't say anything, posttech assayer has no clue what it is. It's a metal that's not in the database. It's extremely resonant at certain frequencies. It will be magnified at certain frequencies. It's very dense, and there's something moving inside of it.

The eight crate contains 50 breakdown climbing poles with razor-sharp crescent hook and barb on the end with a flipovercap for the crescent hook. The whole thing can breakdown and compress to the size of a flashlight. They are shockingly light.

The ninth crate has lanterns. The design is profoundly strange. They don't give out incandescent light - they give out redshift light, not messing with night vision. One is clearly marked as separate. It has an active battery, but doesn't have any noticable effect. It throws out low-grade infrared light.

The last crate contains 50 gas masks and tank sets that look like they hook up. The seals on all of them are completely degraded. The straps on the masks don't look like they'd fit around human heads - they're in the wrong place. If you stretched a human head cartoonishly, it might fit. Otherwise, no. They have two eye spots and a mouth, but would look like a Looney Toons character.

Kruti investigates the strange bird cage device to find it emitting nanoparticles into the area. They're a smart fog, networked and active, with an unclear purpose. They're produced at a continuous rate by the object she's scanning.
