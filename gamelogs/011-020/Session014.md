## 2020-08-22-S -- Session 014

We begin to head back to Carromir. It's uneventful, and takes us 3 hours. We pass by familiar landmarks and arrive back at Carromir. We decide to go back to the Latipan. We spent considerable time discussing flipping the ship.

We've proven ourselves to be reasonable, reliable people. We're her best allies on the ground. We can speak fairly plainly with each other. We explain we have the means to right the ship. The crux of it is that this can't be the last ride of the ship because she owes money on it and it's their means of survival. We discuss things that we can DC reduced, +1 for assist, and we succeed!

We Want:
Transport and cover while we confirm Site 002, and get us off planet with the GN.

They Offer:
Transport, high buzz of Site 002. They need to get off planet, and don't want to risk combat or farting out in atmo.

1. Holes in buildings
   Rahim solves with Talk!

2. Shear rifle speed & accuracy. Preprogram a firing solution.
   Kruti solves with Fix! Emrite solves with Hack!

IT WORKS! We do it, and the ship rights itself. Emrite never has to Impact Sump, and Captain Zarathusa offers us jobs. We politely deflect, and start preparing to leave.

We hear the rumble of the engines igniting, and then the microfusion plant begins to whine. We take off nearly immediately, and are basically ballistically thrust off the planet. We expect to have left an exit crater. After a moment, we hit a high cruising altitude. We have minimal time, and Captain orders the Site 002 buzz. Comms officer will use ship's array to answer questions. We'll get reasonably high-res photos. We see Site 002 and it's a pit with 60-ft towers surrounding it. They're huge, black metal towers with parabolic mirrrors with searchlight-sized lamps focused on them. The mirrors are aligned and projecting active light into the center of the pit. There's a ramp of asphalt leading down from the edge of the pit into the center. Though everything else is still wet from being underwater, the area inside the site is completely dry. There are no shadows inside the pit. It's so illuminated by the towers surrounding and the light reflected from all nearby mirrors, the deepest part of the pit is visible. There we see a massive, opened vault door. The door itself is caked in mud, dead bottom-feeding lake growth, and the area beyond is untouched by the surrounding mess. Beyond the door, human-scaled steps.

We ask for:

1. 3D map - 10-20m
   Officer sounds the pulse array, trying to get a map. It's definitely not normal soil, and couldn't penetrate far. We find out the stairs lead down at least 100m into the earth.
2. geology
   Most of the surrounding area is limestone. Underground caverns, water moving. It's definitely not limestone - may as well be solid stone. All bounce, no data. Only reason we got the shaft was because we were directly overhead. It's unnaturally dense. Looks like material the dam was made of.

Captain gives the command to go into orbit, and we tip back. We breach orbit and are greeted with the sight of the Chalcidony rings surrounding Hartoom. We see the massive, gently rotating structure of the Holy Derelict, in a mild cruise from where we are. The entire crew lets out a relieved sigh. Captain begins giving commands, and we begin to move towards the Derelict. We begin approaching.

We dock at the Derelict and find ourselves again on civilized ground. This is the last rest stop before any of the further systems in the sector. Captain disembarks to resupply. She'll be here about a week for repairs. The whole crew owes us a favor. Spot on the crew is always good, but we also have a favor in our pockets. She departs to get `questionably` drunk. They give us their comm codes and depart for an onboard bar.

We send a message to Vonketosen and squat in the Latipan.

Terran Mandate Technical Manual Speech, a high-density medium for compressing content. It goes through a robotic scanner. Afterwards, we get a summary of the contents from an AI. It's a copy of a copy of a copy. Even though people were careful, it's full of errors and strange delivery. It's a story of two brothers, one dark and evil calling upon hidden powers in his struggle. The good brother battled the bad, and finally locked him away with a seal of water. We get 2000c for it.

The message sent back is text only, but is roughly 50MB.

We get a strange debt collection email back WRT Vonketosen, insinuating we all

We also get a message that is just a subject line:
