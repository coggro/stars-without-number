## 2020-08-08-S -- Session 012

We awake to the bang and try the hidden door. There's no change, and it's still immovable. We decide to wait and see what happens. Kruti looks over the edge and is able to hear a few second order echoes and some laser fire. After a few minutes, it dies down... before abruptly picking back up again. Now it's shouts, ringing out in alarm and anger. Now much clearer sounds of heavy impacts, heavy footfalls, and laser fire. Abruptly, from below us, four people spill out of the breach in the wall at a full sprint. One leaps out of the side into the water, falling down and bouncing off rocks. More sprint as fast as they can go, falling painfully several times. We hear additional heavy metallic footfalls, but nothing else comes out of the dam. A new voice rings we've never heard before rings out from the structure of the dam below, not in a language we speak. It sounds like a pitch-shifted dial-up internet connection. It's a harsh and grating basso screech of digital tones.

We decide to go to Node 8 and consult it to see the differences. We notice that the people who survived fleeing have left, leaving 2 canoes and an outrider watercraft, and a man dead in the pool below. We traverse over to Node 8 and ask for a list of nodes.

```

Requesting information on the newly tripped nodes, and see that NODE 002 activates 5s before NODE 005.

Rahim tries to dig deeper into NODE 011, like what it is and how to access it. It takes roughly an hour to sift through the information. We come to the conclusion that there's a hierarchy of intensity for security, and that that hierarchy starts on the right and ascends to the left, making NODE 011 the highest priority of security. We also get a header that this is highly priveleged information, like SITE_002. After decoding some mutually self-referential ideograms (not a simple language), we learn that this language can't be pronounced with a human throat - but was never meant for a human throat to pronounce. We figure out that NODE 011 is identified as the true purpose of the entire dam facility. The purpose is not to provide hydroelectric power; the majority was used to power the underseers mortal forms, in service of protecting the entities in NODE 011 under radiological lock and key. These things are not referred to as bacteria or disease, but as a group of individuals. It seems like they're using an internal system to refer to these things - TYPHON Specimens (TYPHON is a classification rather than a label). A cognitohazard - something that is dangerous to perceive.

Two Additional Facts:
001: There is only 1 key to the sealing mechanism for the TYPHON Specimen, and it is a precisely calibrated radiologic artifact.
002: Further research at at the collection site at SITE 002 is pending.

We can reset NODE 002, but note NODE 004. Upon checking, NODE 004 has apparently reset itself.

We pack up and head out to find that there was a battle on the other side. There are gouges in the walls, scorch marks from lasers (probably), and lots of blood. Further in, there's a body wearing worker's clothing. They've been torn in half by raw force, staring at the neck/shoulders and continues down to the pelvis. We loot him and find a laser pistol! As Emrite picks it up, she notices that there are too many hands in this pile of person. There's an extra hands. The extra hand is nearly skeletonized and mangled. Kruti takes a look and finds out that it's not just mangled - it's digested. The soft tissues are gone, and it's all bone and thick tendons. It's been sitting in someone's stomach for a while. Additionally, it's around the lower torso of this person. It's likely that they've eaten the hand. It's super gross. She ages it as a prepubescent hand. We hear no movement, but dripping liquid. In the following rooms, we find 10 other shredded bodies. 2 are wearing the white robes, and we find a scattering of laser pistols, table legs, and belaying pins. In the final room, where the robots were,
about 5 of the bodies lie. All 8 of the corroded bots look exactly the same - but are now soaked in human viscera and gore. Additionally, the strike plate is occupied by a ram, occupying the full width and breadth of the ram. After the head, it tapers with enough room for someone to uncomfortably fit behind and into the machinery. She calls us in.

We look in and find that the room feels much smaller with the ram down, and it looks like the ram caught someone, accounting for the final body. Although the robots don't appear to have moved, there are clumps of hair caught in them and stuff. The passage behind the ram is fairly large, but badly caked with industrial grease.

Emrite is able to siphon off a bunch of the grease and put it in a corner. We're able to make our way up the shaft. Our flashlights eventually play over a very strange-looking room. Everything we've seen so far has been very industrial and utilitarian. This room is elaborately decorated, and the floor is a mosaic of black and white tiles. They're 4' x 4' squares. The ceiling above each of the white tiles is a brown, metallic boss of a distorted humanoid face making a blowing expression. Each of those has a clearly visible metal tube between its lips. Around the edges of the room, on each of the black tiles, are upright chest-high black ceramic cylinders. They look to be 3' x 5' with flat bottoms and a clearly separate piece settled on top of them. At the far side of the room is a very small antechamber - 4' x 4' - with stairs leading up beyond.

Kruti goes to step in and has a vision of the stone falling through and plummeting her into a pit, a bunch of LEDs turning on, and a whirring of mechanical objects. She has Emrite push the panel instead, breaking it into the pit. Below, we see dozens of dinner-plate sized roomba-like robots. Emrite taps one with a ball of grease and a couple of yellow LEDs pop up on it, along with all the others. They whirr, and a feathery movement around them. They bounce off each other and keep moving around the room. They hum away for a while. Emrite tries a black square we would've tried. We try floating a compad down to get a look at the floor and find that the remainder of the floor is well-reinforced.

We cross without further incident and find the vault door to the outside, open it, and close it again, knowing it's there. We turn back and experiment with a canister on the checkboard, finding that it's full of atrocious poison or disease of some kind. We continue back further and recover 3 more laser pistols. We then depart to go back to the GN.

As we go along, we see a flicker of movement through the trees of something big, hear a large splash of water, and a wet tearing sound. We hear it again in roughly 30s. Kruti throws a rock elsewhere to distract it, and we both hear and see something very large (like construction equipment), start laboriously trudging in the direction that the rock was thrown. The small trees nearby just collapse between it and the direction of the rock. It plods along at roughly 1/3 the speed of a grown person. It gets close enough that it pops up over the trees, and we see the UR overseer. It has an 8-sided stone mounted where its face would be, and is at least as big as Alnitak was, but is moving much slower. It stops and slowly turns its entire upper torso towards the three of us before rumbling out an address in a voice similar to but not identical to Alnitak.

"What do you revere?"

Kruti looks past to see what looks like a bowl created by thrashing and crushing. In the bowl are drowned bodies ripped apart and scattered around. Kruti tries to read its mind, and finds that it's like pushing her hand through a pile of wet loam. It's waiting for us to say 'revelation'.

Kruti responds, "Revelation."

It does nothing for a long moment before leaning back away from us and heading back to the depression it ground into the flooded earth. It plops down into a meditative posture. As it prostrates itself, it kicks up mud, debris, and mangled limbs before ripping open another body and repeating. It's sad and desparate.

We continue back to where we expect to find the GN and find that something is immediately amiss - it's halfway drifted out of the bower, and is no longer well-hidden. Getting closer, we see two upsetting things:

001 - There is some kind of rod or piece of rebar, like 50" long, sticking out of the main control console of the GN with charring around the entry point, with fletching at the end.

002 - A second arrow of similar size is sticking out of the unmoving body of Douglas Harris, slumped over deck of the GN.

A bioscan suggests that they died 14-16 hours ago. The arrow is about the thickness of a Ticonderoga pencil, and doesn't appear to actually be made of metal - it seems like it's actually some kind of plastic. We try Emma by radio. After a few minutes, we don't get a response. We do, however, hear faint radio feedback. About 80 ft away, we find the radio, a dropped rifle, and no body. There's a considerable population of bootprints there. There is a confusion of scrapes and bootprints, and a spatter of blood. There are two sets of bootprints that head off to the dam. One of them is unlike anything we've seen before, and the other matches Emma's boots. They have a shorter gait leaving. The unknown set of footprints doesn't appear to have been bleeding.

We debate briefly over fixing the GN or finding Emma Harris. We look at the damage and find that it has been expertly fucked. Despite the small size, the GN has 1 HP remaining.
