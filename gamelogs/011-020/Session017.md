## 2020--S -- Session 017 #S017

We begin back in the storage room, seeing that there's another shaft down. Additionally, another wheel with cables that descend into the floor. Upon approaching them, we realize they're chains. We use a lantern from the box, which illuminates a globe of the room in blood red light. The wheel and the chains are patina'd and look old - but are not broken. Looking down into the chain shafts descend past the reach of the light in the left shaft, while the right shaft has an object in the shaft 40 ft down. The chain is connected directly to it, while the other chain descends through a channel in the shaft. The object almost fills the entire shaft. We realize that we're looking at the top of an elevator car. Since we approached the wheel, we notice that the far end of the room has an alcove and a tunnel to proceed.

We go down the tunnel and come to an ornate, nearly circular arch. 15m beyond the edge is a veritically hanging chain, stretching up as far as our light can reach. A narrowing of the calcite structure with another calcite structure. We see that we're midway down a massive stalactite looking at another across from us, with a chain attached up where the two nearly come together. We can see something up near where it attaches - roughly 3-4m above where the chain is anchored is a span of metal bridging the two stalactites. It's vertical, and clearly stained. Above it is a bronze trap door with a yawning, toothed mouth. Across from us, there's no place for us to swing to. Below us, we can see a number of steel cables or chains mounted to the sides of the stalactites and stretching down. They're taut, at complimentary angles between the structures, but we can't see all the way down. There's roughly a dozen of them. The closest attachment point is easily 30m below us.

We return to the storage room to find that nothing has changed in our short absence. We decide to take the ladder hole down. The ladder goes down another 30m, hits an antechamber, and goes down further into a broad hall.

Hanging from the ceiling is a cargo cage. The E and S walls hace stairs down, and another ladder descends into the floor. On the east wall is a garage-door sized bronze door with patterns, gears, and symbols. It's currently down, but is designed to collapse upwards like a garage door. It is broad as a 3-lane highway. On the side of it is a chain pulley linked up to the mechanism by the door. It's roughly human height.

We float a compad up to surveil the cargo cage and find that it's empty. As we're trying to clear floors as we go, we decide to open the bronze door.
