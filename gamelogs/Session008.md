## 2020--S -- Session 008

We get our shit together, including rope, climbing gear, and binoculars, and head out towards the dam again. We intend to ditch the GN.

There are several long, fat-faced fish circling the GN. The fishfinder reveals 14 40-lb fish clustered around the GN. Eventually, Kruuti stabs one, and they go into a frenzy.

Rahim pulls Kruuti away from the frenzy as they jump out of the water against the ship, impacting "like a wet bag thrown by an idiot." Kruti strikes, but doesn't make significant contact. Emrite fires a burst with the shear rifle, but also doesn't make significant contact, either. They leap out at Kruuti and Rahim, dealing damage.

Rahim stabs two, killing them. Kruuti tries to punch a fish with the fish on her arm, failing but killing the attached fish. Emrite used rope to kill 4 fish at once with a telekinetic rope trick. The fish attack Rahim heavily, bringing him down to 5/20.

Rahim cannot bring his knife to bear. Kruuti accidentally hits Rahim instead of a fish. Emrite knocks two fish off, but doesn't clear Rahim. Rahim is nearly killed, but Emrite intervenes with psionics.

The fish are taken care of in the following turn, and we high-tail it back to Carromir for rest and recovery.
