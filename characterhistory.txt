<Character> was hired by <Beaurocrat> to ferry in some antique engraving plates from a vendor to a sattelite office of the Beareau of Engraving and Printing. While preparing for the job, he was contacted by the Daughters of the Dead Moon. Their embedded agent was ready for extraction, and needed transport away from the Beaureau. They arranged the sale and <Character>'s employment as transport, priming him to act as the agent's transfer out.

Upon making contact with him, the <Agent> insisted that he could't leave without first planting a data spike - scrambling the data cores he accessed and several others at random - to cover his tracks. He would need time and access he couldn't manage on his own. He needed <Character> to arrange for a distraction.

So <Character> contracted a professional <Juggernaut>, skilled in miltary-style breaching - exploding in through walls, causing confusion, and executing his operation amidst the chaos. He would hit the facility at the predetermined location and time, provide cover for the <Agent> to plant the spike, snag some cash, tech, or intel for his trouble, and slip into the panicked crowd to be extracted along with the target. If the  stuff he grabbed didn't pan out or 

Everything was put into place - timing locked down, passphrases exchanged to identify one another, and signals established. The delivery portion went off easily enough. No sooner had <Character> carted the last box of plates off of the ship than a dull thud was heard and alarms began sounding. Shouts and screams preceded running employees, and the job was on.

<Character made his way back to the ship and prepared to depart. After some time, several employees arrived in the hangar - among them, two men. One wounded, leaning on the other. They delivered the passphrases - the supporter was the <Agent>, the wounded individual was the <Juggernaut>. He'd taken a survivable shot to the leg, but it meant leaving DNA in a facility he had no reason to be in.

They took off, and weren't shot down. The op seemed to have gone well so far.

The spike worked well enough - or, at least, no reason has been provided so far to think that it didn't. The <Agent> slipped away, and neither the Daughters nor the <Agent> have contacted <Character> yet. 

The <Juggernaut> is laying low. He wasn't able to grab much of anything, and getting shot on the job isn't sitting right with him. He claims a favor from <Character>, but has not yet come to collect.
